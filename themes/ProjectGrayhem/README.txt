MythTV Project Grayhem Theme Version 2.0 26 August 2006

The only requirement (AFAIK) for this theme is the font named 'Verdana'.

Inspired and greatly influenced by Chokemaniac's Project Mayhem (www.chokemaniac.net), this theme was altered from    existing MythTV the$

Thanks to:
               Chokemaniac for creating the very beautiful Project Mayhem III (and everybody who worked on it)
               Jason Gabriele for providing his MediaCenter theme which for the most part is the basis of this theme.
               And finally, thanks to GreyFoxx for sparking my motivation to see this through.

Enjoy!
