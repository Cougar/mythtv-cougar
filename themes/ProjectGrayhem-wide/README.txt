MythTV Project Grayhem Theme < < W I D E > >  

The only requirement (AFAIK) for this theme is the font named 'Vera'.
    
Inspired and greatly influenced by Chokemaniac's Project Mayhem (www.chokemaniac.net), this theme was altered from    existing MythTV themes, and may still contain some elements from them.

Thanks to:
               Chokemaniac for creating the very beautiful Project Mayhem III (and everybody who worked on it)
               Jason Gabriele for providing his MediaCenter theme which for the most part is the basis of this theme.
               Everybody who has downloaded the theme and especially those who have taken the time to comment on it.
               Last and by no means least, GreyFoxx for sparking my motivation to see this through.

Enjoy!
