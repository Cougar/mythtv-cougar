A Note on Upgrading the Music Database Tables
=============================================

If you are installing mythmusic for the first time, you just need to execute
the main metadata.sql script as described in ../README and in the online 
documentation at:

        http://www.mythtv.org/docs/mythtv-HOWTO-15.html

The rest of this document is intended only for those who are upgrading an
existing mythmusic install.

On or around April 16th 2003, the powers that be decided to add an extra
column to the playlists table. You need to do two things:

    1. Edit the 0-8-to-0-9.sql file and change MY_HOST_NAME to the machine 
       that you will be running this instance of mythmusic from. 
       Once you've done that, you need to remove the first line 
       of the file (the one that says "quit").

    2. Run the sql script like this:

        mysql -p -u mythtv < 0-8-to-0-9.sql

Only do this once, not every time you update your cvs copy. Why the
complications? This saves you from having to rebuild all of your playlists.
You're welcome.
