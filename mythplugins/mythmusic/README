                             MythMusic
			Release (towards 0.8)


There'll be more information here later, but for now:

BUILD/CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

First, you need MythTV to be installed.  At the very least, you need MythTV's
database stuff setup properly.  If you don't have that done, don't even bother
with this, as it won't work.

In addition to MythTV's requirements, you'll need these software packages:
(note: _all_ of these exist as software packages in Debian).

   MAD - mp3 decoder library, and it's libid3tag library.  
         http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/

   Vorbis - I've just used this with version 1.0.  You'll need a full install,
            encoding and decoding support.  http://www.vorbis.com

   FLAC - lossless encoder/decoder.  Version 1.0.4 is needed.
          http://flac.sourceforge.net

   libcdaudio - Used to play CDs and to hit FreeDB for CD information.
                I'm using 0.99.6.  http://libcdaudio.sourceforge.net

   cdparanoia - The integrated ripping support uses the libraries from this.
                I'm using cdparanoia III 9.8.  http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/

Optionally:

   fftw   - A very nice library for Fast Fourier Transforms (helps analyze
	    audio data for playback visualizations). Currently using 2.1.3.
	    http://www.fftw.org/

   OpenGL - Just about everyone should have this already (?). 
	    http://www.opengl.org


Phew.  Lotta stuff required. If you're having problems, please check both
the documentation and the mailing list archives at http://www.mythtv.org

Ok.  Once you've got all the prerequisites installed, on to compiling.
There's a configure script in the main distribution directory, but it does
not check for all of the above packages. It's just a tiny little script that
lets you turn on and off support for the fftw and OpenGL libraries. Run it
with './configure --help' to see what you can set.

Now type 'make' in the main distribution directory. 

Compiling note:  If you get an error on building this, that says something
                 about 'mkspecs', then you don't have the QTDIR environment
                 variable set.  On debian, this should be set to /usr/share/qt.
                 I hear on mandrake, it's /usr/lib/qt3.  You'll need to figure
                 out what it should be on your system, set the variable,
                 and attempt to compile again.

If you get any errors about missing references, etc, you most likely don't have
one of the required pieces of software installed.

Follow this by a 'make install'.  It'll put a 'mythmusic' binary in your
/usr/local/bin directory, and stuff mythmusic-settings.txt in your
existing /usr/local/share/mythtv/ directory.

You'll probably want to edit the mythmusic-settings.txt file to set where
your existing music is stored.  This'll also be where new music shows up after
it's ripped.

MythMusic will also read the theme.txt and mysql.txt settings files used by
MythTV, so any changes you made to those will be carried over into this.

The final thing to do is add the musicdb/metadata.sql file to your existing
database setup from MythTV.

So, now you can run mythmusic.  The first time you run it, it'll seem to just 
sit there at first, while it searches the directory you told it music was 
stored in.  It'll print out status messages to the console, so you can hopefully
gauge progress that way..  This may take a while, depends on how much music 
you've already got there.  It's reading all the metadata (vorbis comments, 
id3 tags, etc) and stash the information in the database.  If it's looking 
over a network, the process might take a _long_ time.  Actually, running over 
a network isn't recommended for now, as there's little input buffering, so 
you'll probably have jerky playback.

Once it's done searching for your music, the interface will show up.  It should
be fairly easy to figure out..  Any playlists you create will be saved on exit
and auto-loaded the next time you start mythmusic.
