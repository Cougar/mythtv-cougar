			          Release 0.5


There'll be more information here later, but for now:

BUILD/CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

First, you need MythTV to be installed.  At the very least, you need MythTV's
database stuff setup properly.  If you don't have that done, don't even bother
with this, as it won't work.

In addition to MythTV's requirements, you'll need these software packages:
(note: _all_ of these exist as software packages in Debian).

   MAD - mp3 decoder library, and it's libid3tag library.  
         http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/

   Vorbis - I've just used this with version 1.0.  You'll need a full install,
            encoding and decoding support.  http://www.vorbis.com

   FLAC - lossless encoder/decoder.  Version 1.0.3 is needed.
          http://flac.sourceforge.net

   libcdaudio - Used to play CDs and to hit FreeDB for CD information.
                I'm using 0.99.6.  http://libcdaudio.sourceforge.net

   cdparanoia - The integrated ripping support uses the libraries from this.
                I'm using cdparanoia III 9.8.  http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/

Phew.  Lotta stuff required, and once again I didn't write a configure script
to try and find out if you have it or not.  So if you're missing a dependency,
the compile will fail.

Ok.  Once you've got all the prerequisites installed, on to compiling.
Just type 'make' in the main distribution directory.

Compiling note:  If you get an error on building this, that says something
                 about 'mkspecs', then you don't have the QTDIR environment
                 variable set.  On debian, this should be set to /usr/share/qt.
                 I hear on mandrake, it's /usr/lib/qt3.  You'll need to figure
                 out what it should be on your system, set the variable,
                 and attempt to compile again.

If you get any errors about missing references, etc, you most likely don't have
one of the required pieces of software installed.

Follow this by a 'make install'.  It'll put a 'mythmusic' binary in your
/usr/local/bin directory, and stuff mythmusic-settings.txt in your
existing /usr/local/share/mythtv/ directory.

You'll probably want to edit the mythmusic-settings.txt file to set where
your existing music is stored.  This'll also be where new music shows up after
it's ripped.

MythMusic will also read the theme.txt and mysql.txt settings files used by
MythTV, so any changes you made to those will be carried over into this.

The final thing to do is add the musicdb/metadata.sql file to your existing
database setup from MythTV.

So, now you can run mythmusic.  The first time you run it, it'll seem to just 
sit there at first, while it searches the directory you told it music was 
stored in.  This may take a while, depends on how much music you've already got
there.  It'll read all the metadata (vorbis comments, id3 tags, etc) and stash 
the information in the database.  If it's looking over a network, the process 
might take a _long_ time.  Actually, running over a network isn't recommended 
for now, as there's little input buffering, so you'll probably have jerky 
playback.

Once it's done searching for your music, the interface will show up.  It should
be fairly easy to figure out..  The playlists you select won't be saved across
runs of the program, for now.
