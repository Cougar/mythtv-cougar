Table schema
============

        You can get a good sense for how the tables are laid out by reading
metadata.sql. The main things to realize are:

        1. In the dvdtranscode table, you can define as many rows as you 
           like, but if they are not "sensible" to transcode, then they 
	   won't work. If you know nothing about how transcode works, 
	   you probably don't want to mess with this table.

        2. Because mythdvd is designed to transcode *DVD*'s, this is not
           the place to be thinking of all possible transcode command
           line combinations. In particular the program logic in mythdvd
           will limit the GUI to showing the user only options that
           are valid for the source material. This depends on source 
           material matching an entry in the dvdinput table.
