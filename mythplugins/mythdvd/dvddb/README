A Note on the dvddb
===================

If you are installing mythdvd for the first time, you just need to execute
the main metadata.sql script as described in ../README and in the online
documentation at:

        http://www.mythtv.org/docs/

Table schema
============

        You can get a good sense for how the table is laid out by reading
metadata.sql. The main things to realize are:

        1. (once the dvdtranscode table exists) You can define as mainy 
           rows as you like, but if they are not "sensible" to transcode, 
           then they won't work. If you know nothing about how transcode 
           works, you probably don't want to mess with the table.

        2. Because mythdvd is designed to transcode *DVD*'s, this is not
           the place to be thinking of all possible transcode command
           line combinations. In particular the program logic in mythdvd
           will limit the GUI to showing the user only options that
           are valid for the source material. This depends on source 
           material matching an entry in the dvdinput table.
