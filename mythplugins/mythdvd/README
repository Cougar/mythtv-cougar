                             MythDVD
                           Release 0.? 

    NB: This README is a little ahead of the code ... does not require any
        of transcode, nasm, etc. at this point (soon). Does require 
        libdvdread (and you'll probably want libdvdcss).

GENERAL INFO
------------

MythDVD is a MythTV module (see http://www.mythtv.org) that allows you to play
DVD's on a myth-box and (optionally) rip DVD's and transcode their video and
audio content to other (generally smaller) formats. The playing features are
simply myth-style wrappers for your favourite DVD playing software
(mplayer, ogle, xine, etc). The transcoding is based on and derived from the
excellent transcode package (see below).



BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

First, you need MythTV to be installed. If you don't have that
done, don't even bother with this, as it won't work.

Also, you need MythVideo installed if you want to be able to transcode DVDs
(because mythDVD needs to know where you like to store your videos, and
that's defined in the mythVideo setup).

In addition to MythTV's prerequisites, you'll should have these software
packages installed for *transcoding* to work:

   libdvdread - Needed by transcode and most direct DVD players.
                Crucial for ripping functionality of mythDVD.
                Currently using 0.9.4
                http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd/downloads.shtml

         nasm - Not *strictly* required, but transcode seems happier
                if it's around. Using 0.98.36. You may want to do
                a ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
                http://nasm.sourceforge.net/

   mjpegtools - If you're using a hardware mjpeg capture card, you 
                almost certainly already have this. Transcode wants
                it in any case. Currently using 1.6.1.
                http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net/
                Note that mjpegtools has dependencies of it's own,
                (libmovtar etc.) but that those packages are all 
                available at the mjpegtools site. This includes 
                avifile (0.7.38).

         xvid - A useful MPEG-4 compliant video codec.
                Currently using 0.9.1
                http://www.xvid.org/

       liba52 - Library for dealing with ATSC A/52 (AC-3) for dealing
                with DVD audio.
                http://liba52.sourceforge.net/

      libfame - Transcode will use this if it's installed.
                Currently 0.9.0
                http://fame.sourceforge.net/

    transcode - The core of the ripping/re-encoding process
                (most of the stuff above are things that
                transcode wants for full functionality).
                Developers currently using 0.6.8
                http://www.theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de/
                ~ostreich/transcode/


If you want to be able to read encrypted DVD's, you might want to have this
installed as well:

    libdvdcss - A way to access the bits on that DVD you payed for.
                Probably want 1.2.7
                http://developers.videolan.org/pub/videolan/libdvdcss/   


To simply play DVD's (independent of transcoding), you will need a player.
These have their own dependencies, none of which are listed here. Depending
on your distribution, there may be pre-packaged versions of these
applications available. You'll want one or more of:

      mplayer - You probably already have this working if you have MythVideo
                installed. Try to install as many codecs as possible.
                http://www.mplayerhq.hu/

         ogle - Another player.
                http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd/

         xine - Another player.
                http://xinehq.de/


Ok, still with me? To configure the source code for transcoding, type:

                ./configure --enable-transcode

For just playback, you can do:

                ./configure 

                or

                ./configure --disable-transcode

Next:

                make
                make install


CONFIGURATION
-------------

    You have to go into Setup (Top Level Myth Menu --> Setup --> DVD
Settings) and make some choice. A few (more or less random) thoughts on
these:

        * DVD device should probably be /dev/dvd

        * The command to play a DVD will often be something like
          "mplayer dvd://". But if you need to do special things to your
          sound card (to make it do 5.1 passthrough, for example) or
          otherwise mess with your system, there's no reason it can't be
          a custom shell script. This is also where you want to set 
          language and/or subtitle preferences, decide on menu mode, etc.
          If you come up with a decent shell script that might be of use
          to others, think about contributing it.
