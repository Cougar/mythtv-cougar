The usual bunch of people, probably including:

    Isaac Richards <ijr at po dot cwru dot edu>
    Thor Sigvaldason <myth at lamedomainname dot com>

    Mark Edwards <mark at edwards dot homelinux dot net>

MythDVD relies heavily on the transcode project:

    http://www.theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~ostreich/transcode/
    Main Author: Thomas Östreich <ostreich@theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de>
    Current Maintainer: Tilmann Bitterberg <transcode@tibit.org>

and, by the time anyone reads this file, probably a lot of patch
contributors.
