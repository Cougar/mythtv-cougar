                                   MythWeather
			           Release 0.8c

BUILD/CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

Requirements:
	MythTV (v0.8) installed and working
	Internet Access (to get the weather!)

If you have met the requirements above, simply type 'make' in the main directory
to begin compiling.

Compiling note:  If you get an error on building this, that says something
                 about 'mkspecs', then you don't have the QTDIR environment
                 variable set.  On debian, this should be set to /usr/share/qt.
                 I hear on mandrake, it's /usr/lib/qt3.  You'll need to figure
                 out what it should be on your system, set the variable,
                 and attempt to compile again.


Once the make is completed, do a 'make install'.  

- mythweather will go into /usr/local/bin
- images and weathertype file will be put into the newly created
  /usr/local/share/mythtv/mythweather directory

The software is now installed, one simple configuration must be made:

1. Connect to your SQL server you already have running for MythTV.
2. Issue the following commands (be sure to replace the YOUR_ZIPCODE_OR_AREA_ID,
   see below for more information):

use mythconverg;
insert into settings (value, data) VALUES ('locale', 'YOUR_ZIPCODE_OR_AREA_ID');

  2A. If you want to default to SI units, do the following, if not, skip to #3:
      insert into settings (value, data) VALUES ('SIUnits', 'Yes');

3. Exit out of the SQL server
4. Edit 'mainmenu.xml' in /usr/local/share/mythtv, add the following:

<button>
     <type>WEATHER</type>
     <text>Weather</text>
     <action>EXEC mythweather</action>
     <depends>mythweather</depends>
</button>

5. You're done! Enjoy! See below if you have any problems, ideas, concerns...


MYTHWEATHER KEYBOARD COMMANDS
-----------------------------
   Left Key 		Goes back one page, this also extends the time spent
			on the page you are at. 
   Right Key		Goes forward one page, see above.
   Space		Pause, wait on the current page until space is hit
			again.
   Numeric Keys		You can check other weather by keying in other ZIP codes.
   Enter Key		Switch between celsius and fahrenheit. Can also
			be used a way to force a data update.

OTHER INFORMATION
-----------------
Current the program cycles through the three pages. Each page is 
shown for 10 seconds. When the user intervens and changes the page
it waits for 20 seconds. The weather data is updated every 30 minutes
or until the user selects a new zip code (or even the current zip code
again).  See below for the todo list!


YOUR_ZIPCODE_OR_AREA_ID Information
-----------------------------------
In the United States this is simply your zip code.
It can be an Airport code as well. 

If you're not sure what to put here, goto:
http://www.msnbc.com/news/wea_front.asp?0wl=w3&tab=oth&ta=y
And type in your city name, select the city you live in.

   For Example
   -----------
   If you live in Paris, France -- you would type in Paris.
   A list of 15 or so 'Paris' cities come up, select 'Paris, France'
   Now, in your browser's address bar is:
   http://www.msnbc.com/news/wea_front.asp?pos=&tab=oth&ta=y& \\
   czstr=Paris%2C+France&action=&inst=n&accid=FRXX0076
   Your AREA_ID is   FRXX0076


TODO LIST
---------
   - Ability to save a new location using MythWeather
   - Radar Map Page
   - Finish list of weather types and icons
   - Get a real graphics person to make the weather icons :)

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
I don't have all the weather descriptions and icons. If you see a '?' 
icon or weather description as 'Unknown [XX]', please email and let
me know the XX number, the type of weather at www.msnbc.com for that
day. THANKS!
