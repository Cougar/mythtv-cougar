This is a consolidation of all the official MythTV plugins that
used to be distributed as separate downloads from mythtv.org.

WARNING: You must install MythTV before configuring
         or compiling any of the plugins.

For installation help for everything but mythweb, run:
  ./configure --help

After running configure with whatever options you need, just:

  qmake mythplugins.pro
  make
  make install

There is a README in each plugin subdirectory as well.
