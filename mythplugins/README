This is a consolidation of all the official MythTV plugins that used to be
distributed as separate downloads from mythtv.org.  

For installation help for everything but mythweb, run:
  ./configure --help

After running configure with whatever options you, just:

  qmake mythplugins.pro
  make
  make install

There is a README in each plugin subdirectory as well.
