1. About
========

   MythBrowser is a full fledged web-browser (multiple tabs) to display webpages
in full-screen mode. Simple page navigation is possible. Starting with version 0.31
it also has full support for mouse driven navigation (right mouse opens and closes
the popup menu). Version 0.32 now supports mouse emulation using the number keys
on a remote or keyboard and definable keybindings.

   MythBrowser also contains a BookmarkManager to manage the website links in a
simple mythplugin.



2. Installation
===============

2.1 Prerequisits
----------------

You have to have the KDE development package installed.


2.2 Compilation/Installation
----------------------------

qmake
make
make install


3. Usage
========

  First you have to enter the MythBrowser Settings to define your favorite
webpages and groups. This is also where you can adjust the zoom level of the
fonts on the webpages as well as define the command to execute mythbrowser
(default: PREFIX+/bin/mythbrowser). The Zoom Level is a percentage between 
20 (smaller text) and 300 (larger text).  Check 'Scroll Page' to drag the 
page within the background when moving the mouse while holding 'Alt' or 
pressing the middle button.  If 'Scroll Page' is unchecked then the 
background will be dragged instead of the page.  Set the 'Scroll Speed' 
to a value according to how fast you want this mouse-scrolling to 
scroll.  Then exit setup.

  In the MythBrowser screen you can then select a webpage to display. If
you select (SPACE/Enter) on a group the browser will be started with all
the websites in that group in a different tab (you can switch between the
tabs with the 'P' key).


Default key bindings (use MythWeb to change them):

  Q                     Prev Link (eventually in the prev frame)
  Z                     Next Link (eventually in the next frame)
  ESC                   Exit
  Space/Return          Follow selected link
  R, Backspace          Go back to previous page
  Cursor Up/Down        Scrolling
  Cursor Left/Right     Scrolling
  Page Up/Down          Scrolling
  P                     Switch to next tab
  I                     Show enter URL dialog
  M                     Show popup menu
  <                     Zoom out
  >                     Zoom in
  F1                    Toggle where keyboard input goes to   
  2                     Move mouse pointer up
  8                     Move mouse pointer down
  4                     Move mouse pointer left
  6                     Move mouse pointer right
  5                     Left mouse button click  

Mouse actions:
  
  Right mouse button    Popup Menu
  
  MouseScroll + MidBut  Scroll Page/Background (depending on settings) 
  MouseScroll + AltBut  Scroll Page/Background (depending on settings)
  WheelScroll + MidBut  Zoom Page 
  WheelScroll + AltBut  Zoom Page 

The popup menu (M key) allows to switch between tabs as well.
Furthermore it features a Back menu item, as well as a zoomin and zoomout
menu. Last but not least you can store the current link in the bookmarks
via the popup menu.


4. Hints
========

The F1 key selects where the keyboard input does to. If a web page requires
some sort of input, like an edit control used to enter a search term, pressing
F1 allows you to send all input to the web page. Pressing it again allows
MythBrowser to again capture keyboard input.

The I key opens a dialog allowing you to enter a URL which will be opened in a new 
tab without having to use the BookmarkManager. It is not neccessary to add 'http://'
before a URL MythBrowser will automatically add it if it is missing.

You can get smoother mouse pointer movement by lowering the repeat count for
the remote keys used for mouse emulation in your lircrc config file.

 
5. TODO
=======

- Add OSD message 'Loading... 45%'

- Make it themeable

- Make it handle popup windows properly

- Make it handle links to an anchor within a web page
