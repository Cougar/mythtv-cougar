MythControls
Beta Version

GENERAL
-------

This is an early release of mythcontrols.  There are probably bugs,
and the theme needs alot of work.  Feel free to email me (see the
AUTHOR file) or the developers list with any suggestions or bug
reports.  Actually, _PLEASE_ email me with any theme/interface
suggestions.  If anyone is good with the gimp, I'd love an icon.


BUILD/CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

Adjust your prefix in settings.pro, then execute:

qmake mythcontrols.pro
make


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

Having built MythControls, execute:

make install.


I think that is all you need to do.
