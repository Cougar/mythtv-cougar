                                    MythGame
			          Release 0.8


There'll be more information here later, but for now:

BUILD/CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

First, you need MythTV 0.8 to be installed.  At the very least, you need 
MythTV's database stuff setup properly, and libmyth installed.
If you don't have that done, don't even bother with this, as it won't work.

You will need zlib and zlib-dev, however they're named on your distribution of
choice.

Ok, on to compiling. Just type 'make' in the main distribution directory.

Compiling note:  If you get an error on building this, that says something
                 about 'mkspecs', then you don't have the QTDIR environment
                 variable set.  On debian, this should be set to /usr/share/qt.
                 I hear on mandrake, it's /usr/lib/qt3.  You'll need to figure
                 out what it should be on your system, set the variable,
                 and attempt to compile again.

If you get any errors about missing references, etc, you most likely don't have
one of the required pieces of software installed.

Follow this by a 'make install'.  It'll put a 'mythgame' binary in your
/usr/local/bin directory, and stuff mythgame-settings.txt in your
existing /usr/local/share/mythtv/ directory.

You'll probably want to edit the mythgame-settings.txt file to set where various
emulators are, your rompaths, etc.

Finally, insert gamedb/metadata.sql, gamedb/nesdb.sql, and gamedb/snesdata.sql 
into your existing MythTV database (in that order).

MythGame will also read the mysql.txt settings files used by MythTV, so any 
changes you made to those will be carried over into this.

If you want to use the screenshot-based selection interface, set the ShotCount
setting to 5.  You'll also need MameScreensLocation set to the appropriate
place as well.  If you want NES screenshots, download the screenshots pack from
the MythTV website, un-tar.gz it, and point the NesScreensLocation to the 
appropriate place.

The first time you run MythGame, it'll search out and insert all games that it
finds into its database, so it may seem to take awhile.  Later runs should be
fairly quick.  In the normal text-only selection interface, just navagate around
with the arrow keys, and use space/enter to start a game.  Hitting 'e' on the
game name will take you to a settings dialog, and hitting 'e' on the system
name (ie, MAME), will take you to a system setup menu.  In the screenshot-based
selection menu, just hit tab to switch between navigating the list and the
screenshot section.

To use the generic PC game stuff, check out the example gamelist.xml file
in this directory and modify it/add to it as desired.
