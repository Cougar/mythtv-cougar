			          Release 0.19


BUILD/CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

First, you need MythTV to be installed.  At the very least, you need 
MythTV's database stuff setup properly, and libmyth installed.
If you don't have that done, don't even bother with this, as it won't work.

You will need zlib and zlib-dev, however they're named on your distribution of
choice.

Ok, on to compiling. Just type 'qmake mythgame.pro' then 'make' in the main 
distribution directory.

Compiling note:  If you get an error on building this, that says something
                 about 'mkspecs', then you don't have the QTDIR environment
                 variable set.  On debian, this should be set to /usr/share/qt.
                 I hear on mandrake, it's /usr/lib/qt3.  You'll need to figure
                 out what it should be on your system, set the variable,
                 and attempt to compile again.

If you get any errors about missing references, etc, you most likely don't have
one of the required pieces of software installed.

Follow this by a 'make install'.  It'll put a 'libmythgame.so' plugin in your
/usr/local/lib/mythtv/plugins directory.

MythGame will also read the mysql.txt settings files used by MythTV, so any 
changes you made to those will be carried over into this.
