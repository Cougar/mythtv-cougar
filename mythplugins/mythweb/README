1.0 About
=========

	MythWeb is a set of php files intended (note the use future tense)
to let you access your listings, flag shows for recording, delete
recordings, etc., from a web browser. At some point in the future, it may
allow you to play your recorded content (music and/or(?) video) across a
network. Then again, it may not.

	Note that MythWeb is totally insecure and makes no pretense of
including any security mechanisms of any sort. You should really only run it
on an isolated network or (at the very least) behind a well secured firewall.



2.0 Installation
================

	First of all, you need mythTV, which you should be able to track down
at:

		http://www.mythtv.org

	In addition to all the various things required to get MythTV up and
running (which are documented in the main MythTV source), you need apache
and php up and running on the same machine as MythTV:

		http://www.apache.org
		http://www.php.net

	Current versions of these in use by the MythWeb developer(s) are
1.3.26 for Apache (Apache version 2's do not play nice with PHP) and 4.2.2
for php. Make sure to build both according to the instructions at the php
home site, and be sure to include support for MySQL when building PHP.

	Somewhere in or off your root directory for htdocs (/www/htdocs if
you followed the instuctions at php.net), you should copy
all the files included in this distribution. To make sure you get images
subdirectory, you should do something like

	cp -r . /wwww/htdocs/myMythWebDirectory

	You should then edit the file settings.php (instructions for what to
set are included in the file). That's it. Point your web browser at
http://{whatever your machine is called}/{the directory off htdocs where you
copied the files}. What could be simpler?



3.0 FAQs
========

Q: Why does the red box to indicate that a show is being/has been recorded not
stretch out to the edges of the cell?

A: Not all browsers get the HEIGHT="100%" stuff quite right inside a table
element. Upgrading to a recent copy of mozilla/konquerer/nautilus/opera/lynx
or what have you should (?) solve the "problem". Either that or the guy
writing the php code knows nothing about HTML.



4.0 Notes
=========

- Support has been added for channel based anytime recordings.

5.0 Plan/TODO
=============

	Over the next few days:

		Clean up the code (some of it is very rushed) and
		complete the basic functionality.

	Over the next few weeks:

		Vastly improve design and capabilities so that the
		thing will work well, fast, and completely through
		a standard browser.

	Over the next few months:

		Redo everything with a pure web services (SOAP)
		substructure. This will create an abstract interface
		which can then be called by browser, phone, PDA, other
		software etc., etc. Given that substructure, start to
		think about how to do P2P interactions with a decent
		permissioning mechanism. Lots of potential here.
