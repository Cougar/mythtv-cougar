1.0 About
=========

	MythWeb is a set of php files intended (note the use future tense)
to let you access your listings, flag shows for recording, delete
recordings, etc., from a web browser. At some point in the future, it may
allow you to play your recorded content (music and/or(?) video) across a
network. Then again, it may not.

	Note that MythWeb is totally insecure and makes no pretense of
including any security mechanisms of any sort. You should really only run it
on an isolated network or (at the very least) behind a well secured firewall.



2.0 Installation
================

	First of all, you need mythTV, which you should be able to track down
at:

		http://www.mythtv.org

	In addition to all the various things required to get MythTV up and
running (which are documented in the main MythTV source), you need apache
and php up and running on the same machine as MythTV:

		http://www.apache.org
		http://www.php.net

	Current versions of these in use by the MythWeb developer(s) are 2.0.40
for Apache and 4.2.2 for php.  Make sure to build both according to the
instructions at the php home site, and be sure to include support for MySQL
when building PHP.

    In order for the included .htaccess to work properly, you will need to 
set apache's "AllowOverride" setting to "All" (or at least "Options") for
the root mythweb directory.  This directive lives within <Directory/> tags,
so make sure you're changing the setting for the correct directory.

    At least for the time being, you will also need to make sure that
"short open tags" are enabled in /etc/php.ini (or wherever your favorite
distro chooses to place it).

	Somewhere in or off your root directory for htdocs (/www/htdocs if
you followed the instuctions at php.net), you should copy
all the files included in this distribution. To make sure you get images
subdirectory, you should do something like

	cp -r . /wwww/htdocs/myMythWebDirectory

    Next, you need to make sure that your web server can write to a couple of
directories.  This should be as simple as:

    chgrp -R apache /wwww/htdocs/myMythWebDirectory/{image_cache,php_sessions}
    chmod g+rw /wwww/htdocs/myMythWebDirectory/{image_cache,php_sessions}

	You should then edit the file config/conf.php (instructions for what to
set are included in the file). That's it. Point your web browser at
http://{whatever your machine is called}/{the directory off htdocs where you
copied the files}. What could be simpler?


3.0 FAQs
========

Q: Why don't my sessions stick?
A: Make sure the php_sessions directory has the proper permissions, as detailed
    in INSTRUCTIONS above.

Q: Why is my browser trying to display the PHP code instead of the server
    executing it for me?
A: First, make sure that you have PHP enabled in your webserver settings.  Once
    you have made sure that this is the case, look at the .htaccess file
    included with mythweb and remove (or comment out) the lines that mention
    "zlib".  It seems that some installations don't like these settings in
    .htaccess.  If you wish to enable compression (I suggest you do, since it
    significantly speeds up page-load times), you can safely re-enable these
    settings in /etc/php.ini.

Q: I want to access mythweb from the rest of the internet.
    How do I make it more secure?
A: The main .htaccess file contains commented-out apache controls for enabling
    htpasswd password authentication.  If you uncomment these, and create
    /var/www/htpasswd (see `man htpasswd` for details on how to do this), you
    will have some rudimentary password protection.  Combine this with making
    your mythweb connect only via SSL (see your webserver documentation for
    details), and you will have mythweb as secure as you can get without some
    fancy firewall rules.

4.0 Notes
=========

- Support has been added for channel based anytime recordings.

5.0 Plan/TODO
=============

	Over the next few days:

		Clean up the code (some of it is very rushed) and
		complete the basic functionality.

	Over the next few weeks:

		Vastly improve design and capabilities so that the
		thing will work well, fast, and completely through
		a standard browser.

	Over the next few months:

		Redo everything with a pure web services (SOAP)
		substructure. This will create an abstract interface
		which can then be called by browser, phone, PDA, other
		software etc., etc. Given that substructure, start to
		think about how to do P2P interactions with a decent
		permissioning mechanism. Lots of potential here.
