<h2>Database Setup Error</h2>

<p>
The database environment variables are not correctly set in the<br>
webserver conf or .htaccess file.  Please read through the comments<br>
included in the file and set up the db_* environment variables correctly.
</p>

<p>
Some possible solutions are to make sure that mod_env is enabled<br>
in httpd.conf, as well as having followed the instructions in the<br>
README and INSTALL files.
