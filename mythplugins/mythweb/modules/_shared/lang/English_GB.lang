"info: flvplayer"
    <p>
    Flash video playback is currently only a proof-of-concept and should be
    considered <b>EXTREMELY</b> experimental, which is why it has been disabled by
    default.
    </p>
    <p>
    It currently expects that ffmpeg is installed and compiled with mp3
    support, and that the recordings files are accessible to your webserver
    userid.  It probably won't work with Nupplevideo files, and in the end,
    it may just not work at all (or maybe even worse).
    </p>
    <p>
    Enable this feature at your own risk, and don't expect too much
    official help until it has left the experimental phase.

    Many media players are incapable of playing files that are streamed from<br/>
    https servers.  If you run MythWeb over https, you may want to ALSO create<br/>
    a non-ssl installation and check this box, which will force all streaming<br/>
    downloads to go out over http instead.
"settings: notice"
    Warning:<br><br>Many settings pages have very little error checking. You can easily screw things up if you're not careful, and short of restoring the database from a backup, there is <b>no</b> way to undo your changes.
