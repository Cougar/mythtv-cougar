    <p>
    Flash video playback is currently only a proof-of-concept and should be
    considered <b>EXTREMELY</b> experimental, which is why it has been disabled by
    default.
    </p>
    <p>
    It currently expects that ffmpeg is installed and compiled with mp3
    support, and that the recordings files are accessible to your webserver
    userid.  It probably won't work with Nupplevideo files, and in the end,
    it may just not work at all (or maybe even worse).
    </p>
    <p>
    Enable this feature at your own risk, and don't expect too much
    official help until it has left the experimental phase.
    </p>
