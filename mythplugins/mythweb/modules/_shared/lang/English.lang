    Many media players are incapable of playing files that are streamed from<br/>
    https servers.  If you run MythWeb over https, you may want to ALSO create<br/>
    a non-ssl installation and check this box, which will force all streaming<br/>
    downloads to go out over http instead.
"settings: notice"
    Warning:<br /><br />
    Many settings pages have very little error checking. You can easily screw
    things up if you're not careful, and short of restoring the database from
    a backup, there is <b>no</b> way to undo your changes.
