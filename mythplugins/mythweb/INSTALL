Summary
=======

PLEASE, PLEASE read this document. People seem to skip over this, under the
mistaken assumption that MythWeb will just work with no configuration. While
we've tried to make it as auto-detecting as possible, it usually still needs
some hand-editing to account for variances in install preferences, etc.

Please also read the FAQ in the README file, since it answers several common
post-install questions/concerns.

================
1.0 Requirements
================

First of all, you need MythTV, which you should be able to track down at:

    http://www.mythtv.org

In addition to all the various things required to get MythTV up and running
(which are documented in the main MythTV source), you need apache, perl and php
up and running on either the same machine as MythTV, or one that is not blocked
from communication by a firewall:

    http://www.apache.org
    http://www.php.net
    http://www.perl.com/

Current versions of these in use by the MythWeb developer(s) are 2.2.x for
Apache, 5.1.x for php, and 5.8.x for perl. Make sure to build both apache and
php according to the instructions at the php home site, and be sure to include
support for MySQL when building PHP.

It is also possible to use MythWeb with Lighttpd (Lighty):

    http://www.lighttpd.net/

==========
2.0 Source
==========

There are two official ways to download MythWeb.  You can either download it as
part of the MythPlugins tarball from http://mythtv.org/ or you can grab it
directly from a subversion checkout, as described at http://svn.mythtv.org/trac

Regardless of which method you end up choosing, you should be left with a
directory named mythweb, which contains mythweb.php, mythweb.pl and a handful
of other files/directories (including this file).

* Note, if you would like to check out ONLY MythWeb, you could do something
like the following:

    svn co http://svn.mythtv.org/svn/branches/release-##-fixes/mythplugins/mythweb

Where ## is replaced with the version you want. For instance for the 0.21
release, replace it with "0-21".

===========
3.0 Experts
===========

If you are not an expert, please skip to section 4.0.  Experts, the following
commands should be enough for you to figure out what's going on:

    cp -r mythplugins/mythweb/* /var/www/html/

    vi /var/www/html/mythweb.conf.apache

    mv /var/www/html/mythweb.conf.apache /etc/httpd/conf.d/mythweb.conf

    /etc/init.d/httpd restart

=================
4.0 Everyone Else
=================

If you are reading this section, we're going to assume that you have only
minimal experience configuring both Linux and a webserver.  For those of
you somewhere in between novice an expert, we hope that you do not find
the following sections too boring, but please pay attention in case you
overlook something important.

====================
4.1 Install Overview
====================

Most people will be running their MythWeb installation on the same system that
hosts the MythTV backend server, and will not be running any other web services,
so we will be expecting that you will want to access your machine directly,
like:

    http://192.168.0.50/

The second most common situation would look something like this:

    http://192.168.0.51/mythweb/

The differences between these situations are trivial, and if you cannot figure
out how to do the second location from this guide, please don't hesitate to
drop into #mythtv-users on irc.freenode.net to ask for help.

For the purpose of this guide, we will generally assume that your apache
document root directory is:

    /var/www/html

This is not the case on every system, and you may find that your chosen
distribution has placed it somewhere else.  e.g.

    /home/www/htdocs
    /var/apache
    /var/www
    /var/www/htdocs

For the purposes of illustration, we're going to use the imaginary /web/htdocs
directory to refer to your installation directory.

Once you figure out where your copy of apache is looking for files, copy your
mythweb files into that directory:

    cd mythplugins/mythweb
    cp -R * /web/htdocs/

===============
4.2 Permissions
===============

The next thing you need to do is make sure that your web server can write to
MythWeb's data directory.  This should be as simple as:

    chgrp -R apache /web/htdocs/data
    chmod g+rw /web/htdocs/data

Please note that different distributions use a different userid for apache
(e.g. Ubuntu uses www-data).  Please be aware that you may need to consult
apache's httpd.conf (often found at /etc/httpd/httpd.conf) file to verify which
user/group apache is set to run as.

As a last resort, you can make the directory world-writable:

    chmod a+rw /web/htdocs/data

However, I strongly discourage this, since it is a slight security concern to
give write permissions to any arbitrary user on your system.

=============
4.3 Webserver
=============

As of 0.21, MythWeb contains configuration files for both Apache and Lighty. You
will need to chose ONE of these files and install it in your webserver's
configuration directory.  I will explain this later.

The first thing you must do is find the configuration file for your chosen
webserver, and then follow the instructions in the appropriate subsection

    mythweb.conf.apache         (See section 5.0)
    mythweb.conf.lighttpd       (See section 6.0)

Please do not use Lighttpd unless you know what you are doing.

==========
5.0 Apache
==========

MythWeb relies on two apache modules that are sometimes built in or
enabled by default:

    mod_env
    mod_rewrite

If you compiled apache yourself, or are experiencing server trouble loading
MythWeb, please make sure that these are enabled.

There are also three documented sections in the conf file that are disabled by
default, but I strongly recommend that you enable.  They require:

    mod_deflate
    mod_headers
    mod_auth_digest

To enable these on most systems "a2enmod" will work, for instance on
Ubuntu you need to type these commands before MythWeb will work:
    a2enmod rewrite
    a2enmod deflate
    a2enmod headers
    a2enmod auth_digest

=================
5.1 Apache Config
=================

The directions below will have you set up MythWeb without any authentication
at first, make sure you disconnect the machine from the network for these
steps. For most this will work:
  ifdown eth0
But you can also just unplug the network cable temporarily.

First, open mythweb.conf.apache in your favorite editor and look for what
should be the first non-comment line in the file:

    <Directory "/var/www/html" >

You should change that path to match the document root directory you discovered
in section 4.0, such that it might look something like:

    <Directory "/web/htdocs" >

Continue on in the file and find the following lines:

    setenv db_server        "localhost"
    setenv db_name          "mythconverg"
    setenv db_login         "mythtv"
    setenv db_password      "mythtv"

You should update these so that they match the settings required to connect to
your MythTV master backend.

There are other settings in this file, too, which should be fairly well
documented.  Please read through the comments in the file itself to see if you
can benefit from features that are disabled by default, or settings required
for some of the more exotic installation possibilities.

Finally, you should put this file into apache's "extra config files" directory.
On Fedora, this is:

    /etc/httpd/conf.d/

Other distributions might use something like:

    /etc/apache/conf.d/
    /etc/apache2/conf.enabled.d/

Generally if there /etc/apache2/sites-available or similar directory you
want to place this there and then run:

    a2ensite mythweb.conf

You will have to figure out the correct path on your own, but once you do, move
the MythWeb config file into place like so:

    mv mythweb.conf.apache /etc/apache2/conf.d/mythweb.conf

Then start/restart apache:
  /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
  /etc/init.d/apache2 start
Or similar, this depends on the distribution.

Now you should be able to load mythweb. If you do not please review the
mythweb.conf file and this document for any potential mistakes you may
have made. Please read the next section before re-enabling the network.
If you still can't get it to work, disable apache, using something like:

  /etc/init.d/apache2 stop

Then re-enable the network using:

  ifup eth0

Or, plugging the network cable back in, depending on how you disabled it
earlier. Now google for the error message you see at the end of:

  tail /var/log/apache2/error.log

or similarly named error log for apache. Chances are someone else has
had the same problem before and found a solution.


==========================
5.2 Apache Security Config
==========================

The next step is to make sure everyone in the world can't take over your
machine and that web crawlers don't automatically delete all your recordings.

In the mythweb.conf file there is an authentication section. For this
to work you will need to run this for the first user:

  htdigest -c /etc/mythweb.password.digest MythTV username

And this for each additional user:
  htdigest /etc/mythweb.password.digest MythTV username

Uncomment all the directives in this section of the file and change
/var/www/htdigest to /etc/mythweb.password.digest or whatever else
you want to call the password file. Do not place the file anywhere
below /var/www or it will be world accessible. /var/www/htdigest
would be the absolute worst name to use, since it appears in the
mythweb documentation which the bad guys read for easy breakins.

The next step is to reload apache so it can use the new configuration:
  /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
  /etc/init.d/apache2 start
Or similar, this depends on the distribution.

Now when you access the mythweb pages it should prompt you for a username
and password. Type these in and make sure things work.

Ok, if you reached this step you are almost done! Just plug in the
network cable or type "ifup eth0" if you used "ifdown eth0" to disable
the network earlier.
