                                   MythVideo

BUILD/CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

Requirements:
	MythTV installed and working

If you have met the requirements above, simply type 'make' in the main directory
to begin compiling.

Compiling note:  If you get an error on building this, that says something
                 about 'mkspecs', then you don't have the QTDIR environment
                 variable set.  On debian, this should be set to /usr/share/qt.
                 I hear on mandrake, it's /usr/lib/qt3.  You'll need to figure
                 out what it should be on your system, set the variable,
                 and attempt to compile again.


Once the make is completed, you should switch to root and do a 'make install'.  

- mythvideo will go into /usr/local/bin
- the mythexplorer-settings.txt will go into the /usr/local/share/mythtv directory

Before running mythvideo, edit the /usr/local/share/mythtv/mythexplorer-settings.txt
file and adjust your StartDir.  By default, it is set to /mnt/store

The default media player is set to mplayer, and will default to full-screen
mode.  If you do not want full-screen mode, remove the "-vm" parameter.

If you wish to add helper applications, they must be defined as 
str <format>_helper=<program>
