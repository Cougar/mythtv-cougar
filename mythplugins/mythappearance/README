                                   MythAppearance


GENERAL INFO
------------

MythAppearance is a new (and intended to be temporary - until it's included in mythfrontend) plugin intended to ease setting up the GUI size of mythfrontend.

USAGE
-----

When first run, mythappearance presents the user with an arrow located at the top left corner of the screen.  The arrow can be moved to the visible edges of the 
screen with the arrow keys.

Pressing SELECT shows an arrow in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.  Again the arrow can be moved to the visible edges of the screen with the arrow 
keys.

Pressing ESC quits the plugin & discards any changes.

Pressing MENU shows a menu which can be used to change the arrow movement amount (toggles between coarse (10 pixels at a time) and fine (1 pixel at a time)).  
The same menu also allows the screen size & offset amounts to be reset to a default of zero effectively making mythfrontend use the whole screen again.
Within the menu is also an option to save the newly changed settings & quit the plugin.
