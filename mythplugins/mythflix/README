MythFlix (A NetFlix MythTV)
---------------------------------------------------------------------


INSTALLATION:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Unzip the mythflix-x.x-x.tgz to the mythplugin-x.x-x directory.

type 'qmake mythflix.pro' in the mythflix directory to create the Makefile.

type 'make' in the mythflix directory to begin compiling

Compiling note:  If you get an error on building this, that says
		something about 'mkspecs', then you don't have the 
		QTDIR environment variable set.  On debian, this 
		should be set to /usr/share/qt3.

Once the make is completed, do a 'make install' as root

- libmythflix.so will go into /usr/local/lib/mythtv/plugins
- data files will be put into the 
  /usr/local/share/mythtv/mythflix directory
- image files and ui file go to /usr/local/share/mythtv/themes/default

Run mythfrontend and setup the Netflix RSS feeds to include when you browse
for movies.  You MUST run the mythfrontend first to give the plugin a chance
to intial the database before continuing. See CONFIGURATION/USAGE.

Currenty, MythFlix plugin lacks a more rebust configuration UI.  So your
netflix account settings need to be initilized manually.
To do this run the following command.  For some reason to properly intialized
the netflix cookie you must run script twice.  The '-q queueName' part is
optional and if specified will allow MythFlix to support multiple NetFlix
queues.  This queue name is an internal name Myth uses to show you what
NetFlix queue you are currently viewing, it does not have to be the same as
the user/queue name on the NetFlix website.

/usr/local/share/mythtv/mythflix/scripts/netflix.pl <-q queueName> -L <userid> <passwd>
/usr/local/share/mythtv/mythflix/scripts/netflix.pl <-q queueName> -L <userid> <passwd>

FINAL INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------

After running the plugin once you must manually enter your NetFlix Queue RSS
feed into the database.  This can be found by going to NetFlix.com, login,
click RSS feed at the bottom of the page. Cut and paste the url into netflix
table with the is_queue flag set.  If you specified a queueName above, you
need to use that queueName in the SQL below, otherwise leave the queueName
field empty (ie, '') in the SQL.  The RSS feeds are unique for each Queue
you create on the NetFlix website, so be sure to specify the correct RSS feed
URLs for your MythFlix queues.
  
  insert into netflix values ("Queue","NetFlix", '[YOUR QUEUE RSS URL]','http://cdn.nflximg.com/us/icons/nficon.ico', null, 1, '[YOUR QUEUENAME SPECIFIED ABOVE]');
  insert into netflix values ("History","NetFlix", '[YOUR HISTORY RSS URL]','http://cdn.nflximg.com/us/icons/nficon.ico', null, 2, '[YOUR QUEUENAME SPECIFIED ABOVE]');
