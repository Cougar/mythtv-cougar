MythArchive
===========
MythArchive is a MythTV style plugin that uses the Mythburn Script to
create and burn DVD's from MythTV recordings, MythVideo files or any
video files available on a MythTV system. It can also export recordings 
to a native archive format that can then be imported back into a mythtv 
system restoring all the associated metadata.

PREREQUISITES
=============

You need to have already installed the external dependencies required
by the mythburn script.

Python2.3.5
python2.3-mysqldb
python2.3-imaging (PIL)
mjpegtools mplex-2 version 1.6.2 (2.2.3)
ffmpeg version 0.4.9-pre1
DVDAuthor::dvdauthor, version 0.6.11
mkisofs 2.01a34-unofficial-iconv
growisofs
tcrequant (optional)

COMPILE AND INSTALL MYTHARCHIVE
===============================

Do the usual install routine. (change the prefix to suit your system)

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
# make install


FEATURES / HOW-TO-USE
=====================

If you run mythfrontend there should now be two extra menu items.
One runs the MythArchive plugin the other shows MythArchive's settings
page. 

IMPORTANT - The first thing you should do is check the settings.
Make sure you set the temp directory setting. There should be a lot
of space at this location for the script to create all its work files.


Now you can run the MythArchive plugin. First you need to cue some
files for archiving from the "Find Files To Archive" menu. You can 
choose MythTV recordings, MythVideo files or any media file accessible
from your filesystem.

Next you select items you would like to burn from the "Export Video File" 
menu. If available you can tell MythArchive to use the cut list to cut
out commercials etc. If you need to edit the details of an item. Press
'MENU' and select "Edit Details" to show the 'Edit Details Dialog'.

Next select a menu theme.

Finally review what files have been selected and if you are happy
click 'Finish' to start the DVD creation process. You can monitor
the progress in the log viewer or exit the log viewer and continue
to use myth.

Keys:-
* Up/Down/Left/Right - move focus/change selection
* Select             - activate push button/toggle selection 
* Exit               - return to myth main menu  
* C                  - toggle use cut list

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

1. The script fails with "ERROR: Failed to init mythcontext." message.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The most likely cause of the error is the MythContext cannot find a valid 'mysql.txt' file.
You are most likely to see this problem when using the web interface and the user that 
your web server is using doesn't have a home directory.

There are two ways to fix this error:
    a) Create a home directory for the user running your web server and copy a valid 'mysql.txt'
       file into that directory.
    b) or copy a valid 'mysql.txt' file to either INSTALL_PREFIX/share/mythtv/ or /etc/mythtv/

You should find a copy of your mysql.txt file in one of the following locations:-
    INSTALL_PREFIX/share/mythtv/mysql.txt
    /etc/mythtv/mysql.txt
    ~/.mythtv/mysql.txt


2. The script fails with "ERROR: Failed while running growisofs." message.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most likely cause of the error is insufficient file permissions on the cdrom device.
Make sure the user that is running the script can both read and write to the device that 
you use to burn dvd's.

How you do that is dependent on how your distribution sets things up. It may be sufficient to
add the user to the 'cdrom' group. You may also have to relax the permissions on the device
itself to allow the cdrom group read/write access to it.
