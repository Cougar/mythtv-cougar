CONFIGURATION/USAGE:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have installed mythnews you need to set it up. Go to
Settings->NEWS Settings (This will setup the mythnews database for you
automatically). On the Settings page there will be news feed sites on
the left window. Double clicking or selecting and pressing
return/space will add them to the database (These will also be shown
on the right window). If you need to add a custom news feed site then
add them using the "custom" button. Also set the frequency (in
minutes) with which the news should be updated (Note: the minimum
value is 30 Min to prevent DOSing the news sites). Now exit the setup
page (by pressing ESC).

Go to the NEWS main page and you should see the news feed sites on the
left column and corresponding news articles on the right). You can
move between news sites/articles using the UP/DOWN keys and between
the news sites column and articles column using the LEFT/RIGHT
keys. Pressing "U" will update all unupdated news. Pressing "F" will
force updating news from all sites (WARNING: Don't use this key
frequently unless you want to DOS the news sites and get locked). The
news gets updated automatically depending on the frequency which you
set in the setup page.
