Note:  Please report any issues with this theme to jdonavan@jdonavan.net with the subject "Minimalist feeedback".

This is the first of the wide-screen enabled themes.  It's based loosly on the Titivillus theme, however it uses FAR fewer images.  

The theme isn't 100% complete and polished as of the .17 release but all major areas have been covered.
