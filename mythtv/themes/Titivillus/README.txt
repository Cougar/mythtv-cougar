Note:  Please report any issues with this theme to jdonavan@jdonavan.net with the subject "Titivillus feeedback".
The latest version of this them can always be found at: http://www.jdonavan.net/myth

This theme started as variation of G.A.N.T. with only real differences being the colors and images used.  It's slowly diverging as I tweak things.

NOTE: This requires Myth .15 or higher due to the addition of the "hcenter" attribute for centering text.

There is a matching OSD theme as well.
