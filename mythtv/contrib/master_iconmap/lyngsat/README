This script downloads the complete station icon list from lyngsat-logo.com and
stores it in the sqlite3 database file named station_info.sqlite.  This
database will eventually contain xmltvid and callsign lookups to match
mythtv stations with the appropriate lynsat logo.

The format from --output (currently also stored in lyngsat_stations.txt)
contains each station name, followed by two indented lines containing the
small and large logo URLs in a format ready to be inserted into
networktourl.txt for build_map.pl
