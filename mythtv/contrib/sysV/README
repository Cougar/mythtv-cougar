This is a collection of files for various distributions.  They should all
relate to automatic start/stop via the UNIX SysV daemon system (commonly
known also as init.d).

The "init" files should usually go into /etc/init.d/ or /etc/rc.d/init.d/, but
you should check to make sure that is the correct path for your chosen
distribution.

The "sysconfig" files should go into /etc/sysconfig/, with the same caveat.

They should both be renamed to remove any header information.  E.g.

    fedora.init.mythbackend  ->  /etc/init.d/mythbackend
