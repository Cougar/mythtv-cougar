<UL>
<LI>You have an AMD K6-2 or VIA C3 processor.  If you have either of
these, make sure that you you followed the instructions in this

</H2>

<P>If mythfilldatabase suddenly appears to be failing, check to see what version of
XMLTV you're running.  Versions prior to 0.5.4 need to have the following
change made: edit the
<CODE>/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/XMLTV/ZapListings.pm</CODE> file and
perform a global search and replace, searching for "tvlistings2" and
replacing it with "tvlistings".
<B>NOTE</B>:  It is highly recommended to run the latest version of XMLTV
available.  In North America, zap2it, the listings provider, has been
making numerous changes to their website which negatively impact XMLTV.</P>

</H2>

<P>First, you should check that your kernel has been enabled for DMA:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[mythtv@pvr mythtv]$ dmesg |grep DMA
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd800-0xd807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd808-0xd80f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hda: 156301488 sectors (80026 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=9729/255/63, UDMA(33)
hdb: 80043264 sectors (40982 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=4982/255/63, UDMA(33)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>From the listing above, you can see that hda, hdb and hdc are set for DMA,
and hdd is set for pio.  If your kernel is not reporting DMA being enabled,
you may need to recompile your kernel. Check your motherboard's chipset
(look in the "ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support" section in "make menuconfig") for more
information.</P>
<P>Next, check that the hard drive has DMA enabled.  Use the <B>hdparm</B>
program to check and enable DMA.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# hdparm -d /dev/hd?
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 will tell you the DMA status for your hard drives.  If you run
<B>hdparm</B> with the <CODE>-d1</CODE> parameter, it will turn DMA on.</P>

<P>You may also setup your PC to do this at boot time, either by adding the
command to your <CODE>/etc/rc.local</CODE> file, or by adding files to
/etc/sysconfig.</P>
<P>On Mandrake and other distributions, if you install <B>hdparm</B> from an RPM you
will most likely get a <CODE>/etc/sysconfig/harddisks</CODE> file installed. 
This file will be parsed by the <CODE>/etc/rc.sysinit</CODE> script.  If you use
the default <CODE>harddisks</CODE> file, your changes will affect all IDE devices
(including CD ROMs).  If you wish to use different parameters for various
devices, rename and/or copy the file to <CODE>harddiskhda</CODE>,
<CODE>harddiskhdb</CODE>, etc.  Edit the file to your liking and on the next
reboot your setting will be preserved.</P>

</H2>

<P>This is a different problem than the one discussed in the previous
section.  Currently, the ivtv driver or firmware appear to have some issues
if the vertical capture resolution is not the full screen height.  If you
are having a jitter problem then ensure that you are capturing either 480
lines (for NTSC) or 576 lines (for PAL).  The default capture profiles may
need to be edited for your setup.  Go to Settings->TV Settings->Recording
Profiles and adjust the <B>Default</B> and <B>Live TV</B> options to
480 or 576 from their defaults.</P>

<P>Some compile errors are worse than others.  If you get an error that
doesn't abort the compilation, and says something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

then it shouldn't be a problem.</P>
<P>If you get an error like <CODE>/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXext</CODE>, the
compiler is telling you that you don't have XFree86-devel installed, or that
your distribution hasn't set it up correctly.  This needs to be fixed before
MythTV will compile.</P>

</H2>

<P>This is due to DPMS, the Display Power Management System, which is used
to save power by turning off your monitor when the system decides that it's
not being used or to a screensaver that has defaulted to a blank screen. 
Since it's likely that watching TV will not generate keyboard or mouse
events for a time, you need to turn off DPMS and the screensaver.  There are a few ways to do
this.  You may also need to check your BIOS for power saving modes and
disable screen blanking there as well.</P>
<P>Edit your <CODE>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</CODE> file, and look for:

</H2>

<P>By Bruce Markey, 
<A HREF="mailto:bjm@lvcm.com">mailto:bjm@lvcm.com</A>
<B>NOTE</B>:  the following instructions do not apply to PVR-250/350
encoders; the MPEG-2 file will have the audio embedded in the stream so it
is not accessible using <CODE>/dev/dsp</CODE>.  See 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-22.html#troubleshooting_pvraudio">this</A> in the PVR-250 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-22.html#pvr250">section</A> for more information.</P>
<P>Audio appears to be one of the bigger issues that users run into on the
mailing list.  If the audio isn't configured correctly, then MythTV will
often appear to hang, when in fact it is trying to manipulate the audio
subsystem and failing.  You may or may not receive error messages indicating
that the source of the error is the audio subsystem.</P>
<P>You can not use <B>xawtv</B> to determine if your audio is working
correctly, since <B>xawtv</B> is simply using the the analog sound patched
through line-in to line-out. It doesn't need to digitize the sound unless
you are using the recording function.</P>
<P>A better test to verify that sound will work for MythTV (and recording with
<B>xawtv</B> for that matter) is to startup <B>xawtv</B>, mute the
line-in then run <CODE>aplay /dev/dsp</CODE>. You should hear the recorded audio
slightly delayed behind the real-time video.  Once this test succeeds, MythTV
should work correctly because it writes to and read from /dev/dsp in
the same way that <B>aplay</B> does.</P>
<P>To record audio along with video the audio signal must be digitized by a DSP
so that the audio data can be stored in a file. On playback, the audio data
is written to /dev/dsp and converted back to an analog signal. This analog
signal should then be sent to your speakers. Here is what is needed in
alsamixer:</P>
<P>CAPTUR source - the analog source to be sent to the DSP. This should be set
to the input source from the tuner card to the sound card. In most cases
this is Line but this could also be Aux, CD, Mic, etc., depending on how you
connect the input cable. This source should be muted to prevent patching
through the analog sound. The volume of this source will not affect the
record level.</P>
<P>Capture mixer - this sets the level for the analog to digital recording.
While a volume of 100% is recommended for testing, distortion may occur.
Lowering this level to 75% to 85% may result in better audio quality.
"Capture" should be marked as the CAPTUR destination.</P>
<P>PCM mixer - this sets the level for the digital to analog playback. While a
volume of 100% is recommended for testing, distortion may occur. Lowering
this level to 75% to 85% may result in better audio quality.</P>
<P>Master mixer - sets the level for the analog signal sent to line-out or the
speakers.</P>
<P>You may also want to ensure that <CODE>/dev/dsp</CODE> hasn't already been
grabbed by another process, like <B>esd</B> or <B>artsd</B>.  If
<CODE>/dev/dsp</CODE> isn't available, then MythTV won't work.  </P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: The CVS version of MythTV now has support for using
<B>artsd</B>.  This is a compile-time option, so you will need to edit the
<CODE>settings.pro</CODE> file in the mythtv directory then perform a <CODE>make
distclean; make</CODE>, and re-run <CODE>make install</CODE> as root to add this
support.  Otherwise, check your window manager documentation for
instructions on disabling the sound manager.</P>
<P>If you wish to see what application is grabbing a resource, you can use the
<CODE>fuser</CODE> command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# fuser -v /dev/dsp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>To disable aRts in KDE, go to KDE->Control Center->Sound->Sound System and
uncheck the "Start aRts soundserver on KDE startup" box.  Run <CODE># killall
artsd</CODE> from the command line to stop the artsd program.</P>
<P>If you're using multiple sound cards and multiple tuners, use <CODE>alsamixer
-c 1</CODE> to work with the second sound card.  The first card is #0, the
second card is #1, etc.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss20.13">20.13</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc20.13">The mythbackend program told me to look at this section.</A>
</H2>

<P>mythbackend does a check to see if your sound device is capable of full
duplex operation.  If it's not, it's most likely that you're going to run
into issues when you try to record and play sound at the same time.  If your
backend is a separate machine than your frontend, then there's no problem,
since you're only going to be doing one thing at a time with the card. 
Likewise, if you're running the frontend and backend on the same machine,
but you're using btaudio or a Hauppauge PVR-250 as your recording source,
and using the playback function of your sound card, then you also shouldn't
have an issue, since the sound card isn't being asked to perform two
functions at once.</P>
<P>If you can't get your sound card to go full duplex and need it to, then check
your distribution for updated sound drivers.  If your sound card is not
capable of full-duplex operation, either because the drivers don't support
it, or it has been designed that way, then you're pretty much out of luck
and will either need to purchase a new sound card, or will need to get

<P>This can be due to a number of factors.  The simplest case is the

<P>XVMC is a NVidia driver feature which is supposed to help with decoding
video.  Users have reported that rather than speeding up their video it
appears to be doing the opposite.  You may want to check that your color
