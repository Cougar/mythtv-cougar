</H2>

<P>LVM greatly increases the flexibility you have in managing your storage
than traditional physical partitions. This section will provide some brief
notes on how to use LVM to create storage space for your video files and how
to add additional disk space in the future. There's lots more that can be
done with LVM, so check the LVM HOWTO 
<A HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/</A> document for details.</P>
<P>If you don't understand how to partition a drive, or how to change the
partition type you should stop and look at documentation on how to perform
these steps.</P>

<CAPTION><B>BIG FAT WARNING</B>:  Using an incorrect parameter can make your files
inaccessible, prevent your computer from booting, etc.  Be careful!</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>
</P>
<P>Make sure your kernel configuration includes LVM support or that it's
available as a module. Today, most vendors include this by default. You'll
also want to ensure that you have a copy of the LVM utilities; check your
distribution, or get the latest versions from 
<A HREF="http://www.sistina.com/products_lvm.htm">http://www.sistina.com/products_lvm.htm</A> and build them manually.</P>
<P>Check that the <B>vgscan</B> program is being run at some point during
your boot sequence - most distributions do this by default. Look for a
message during boot up that looks like this: <CODE>vgscan -- reading all
physical volumes (this may take a while...)</CODE> If you don't see any
messages during boot, you may need to install a LVM init script or confirm
that you have all of the LVM packages installed from your distribution.</P>
<P>LVM uses a few concepts you should be familiar with before starting.
<UL>
<LI>PV (Physical Volume).  The actual partition on the hard drive.</LI>
<LI>VG (Volume Group).  The aggregation of all the PVs make a VG.</LI>
<LI>LV (Logical Volume).  Subdivision of the pool of space available in
the VG into individual chunks, like /usr, /var/video, etc.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The following example assumes that you want to create a LVM partition from a
chunk of space in /dev/hda5, using a reiserfs filesystem and mounted on
/var/video. You later decide to extend this filesystem by adding a new disk:
/dev/hdb.</P>
<P>You need to create at least one LVM partition for a physical volume. Use
<B>fdisk</B> or your favorite partition editor to set the type to LVM
(0x8e). If you're using an entire disk, create one big partition rather than
using the device itself. e.g. use /dev/hdb1 not /dev/hdb.  </P>
<P>In the following example, you have a 15GB disk.  The first 6GB are set as
your boot partition.  <CODE>/dev/hda2</CODE> was added as an extended partition,
and within that partition you created the <CODE>/dev/hda5</CODE> linux (ext2)
partition.</P>

# fdisk /dev/hda

The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 1823.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)

<P>Create the LVM physical volume from the partitions (repeat if you have
multiple partitions to use):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# pvcreate /dev/hda5
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Create a LVM volume group out of this physical volume called "VGforMyth" that is
allocated in chunks that are a multiple of 64MB
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# vgcreate VGforMyth -s 64m /dev/hda5

Create a logical volume of 5GB called "video" and then create the reiserfs
filesystem and mount it:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# lvcreate --name video --size 5G VGforMyth
# mkreiserfs /dev/VGforMyth/video
# mount /dev/VGforMyth/video /var/video
</PRE>

Now create a 3GB volume for mythmusic files if you like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# lvcreate --name music --size 3G VGforMyth
# mkreiserfs /dev/VGforMyth/music
# mount /dev/VGforMyth/music /var/music
</PRE>

Display the volume group status:
<CODE># vgdisplay -v</CODE></P>
<P>Now, lets suppose you want to add a 60GB hard disk to the system as hdb and
allocate 50GB of it to video storage.</P>
<P>First, create a single partition /dev/hdb1 covering the whole disk and make
it type 0x8e using your partition editor.</P>
<P><CODE># fdisk /dev/hdb</CODE>
.... create partition, set type, save and reboot if it says you have to</P>
<P>Create the new LVM physical volume:</P>
<P><CODE># pvcreate /dev/hdb1</CODE></P>
<P>Add the new physical volume to the volume group:</P>
<P><CODE># vgextend VGforMyth /dev/hdb1</CODE></P>

<H2><A NAME="advancedpartitionformatting"></A> <A NAME="ss24.2">24.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc24.2">Advanced Partition Formatting </A>
</H2>

<P>The partitions that your distribution sets up for you may not be
optimized for large files. Using LVM in conjunction with the following
techniques can be quite useful.</P>
<P>Unlike a typical filesystem, a MythTV video partition is usually a very
large filesystem filled with a fairly small number of large files.
Filesystem I/O is usually not an issue, even in multi-tuner and/or
multi-frontend setups.</P>
<P>There is however, one aspect of filesystem performance that can have a
bearing on the performance of MythTV.  In Linux, deleting a file will
utilize I/O bandwidth until the deletion has been completed.  If deleting
the file takes long enough, the video capture buffer may overrun, thereby
resulting in dropped frames.  Some filesystems are faster at deleting files
than others and, for multi-gigabyte MythTV video files, these differences
can be significant.</P>
<P>Fortunately, there are published tests (
<A HREF="http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html">http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html</A>) that provide
insight into filesystem performance under conditions relevant to MythTV
usage.  In addition, some limited testing (archived at 
<A HREF="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/users/52672">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/users/52672</A>)
with very large files (10 gigabytes) was reported in the MythTV Users
mailing list.</P>

<H3>Ext2</H3>

<P>Ext2 was the defacto standard Linux filesystem for many years.  It is
stable, provides good I/O performance and can quickly delete large files. 
The primary disadvantage of Ext2 is that it is not a journaling filesystem,
so a file system consistency check (fsck, which is normally only performed
after a system crash) can take many hours on a filesystem the size of a
typical MythTV partition.</P>

<H3>Ext3</H3>

<P>Ext3 is Ext2 with a journal, so your biggest gain is that in case of a
crash and reboot you won't have to wait very long for your partition to be
remounted.</P>
<P>There are options available when formatting an Ext3 partition, as in:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mkfs.ext3 -T largefile4 /dev/hdb1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This example assumes that <CODE>/dev/hdb1</CODE> has already been created using
<B>fdisk</B>. If you're using LVM, <CODE>/dev/hdb1</CODE> may be something like
<CODE>/dev/VGforMyth/video</CODE>.</P>
<P>The "-T largefile4" option creates one inode per 4 megabytes, which can
provide a few percent more storage space.  However, tests indicate that
using the "-T largefile4" option can drastically increase the amount of time
required to delete a large file and thus it should only be used with encoder
settings that produce small video files (YMMV).</P>
<P>You can check on your filesystem using the <B>dumpe2fs</B> program. See
the man page for details.</P>
<H3>ReiserFS</H3>

<P>The Reiser filesystem is another journaling filesystem commonly
distributed with Linux.  It is known to be an extremely efficient filesystem
and it especially excels at managing partitions containing a large number of
small files.  However, tests indicate it is not the fastest at deleting very
large files.  For that reason, it may not be the best choice when using
encoder bitrates that produce very large files.</P>

<H3>JFS</H3>

<P>JFS (Journaling File System) is a journaling filesystem originally
developed by IBM for AIX which was later released as open source.  While not
as common as Ext3 or ReiserFS, it is distributed with RedHat 9 (RH9), Fedora
Core and Mandriva as well as other distros.  According to tests, JFS is the
file deletion speed king, deleting virtually any file in under one second,
even files as large as 10 gigabytes.</P>

<H3>XFS</H3>

<P>XFS is a journaling file system originally developed by SGI for Irix, and
later released as open source.  While not a part of the default RedHat Linux
9 or Fedora Core installation (although it is a part of Mandriva and Fedora
Core 2), it can be easily installed via ATrpms.  XFS provides deletion
speeds for large files only slightly slower than JFS.  According to the test
results shown at (
<A HREF="http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html">http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html</A>), XFS provide
higher I/O rates than JFS, albeit at a higher CPU loading.  This may cause
issues if you do not have the spare CPU capacity to handle XFS, potentially
leading to dropped frames.</P>
