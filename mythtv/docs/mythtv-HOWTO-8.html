<H2><A NAME="s8">8.</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8">Configuring mythtv.</A></H2>

<P>By this point, all of the prerequisites have been installed,
<B>mysql</B> is running and has had its initial database setup.  It's now
time to configure mythtv.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.1">Editing the settings.txt file.</A>
</H2>

<P>Open a shell and switch to the <CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv</CODE> directory. 
You <B>MUST</B> edit the <CODE>settings.txt</CODE> file so that it's
appropriate for your system.  At a minimum, ensure that the BufferName, RecordFilePrefix
and PIPBuffername variables are set to directories that exist on your system. 
By default, these point to <CODE>/mnt/store</CODE>.  For example, you may wish to create
a <CODE>/var/video</CODE> subdirectory, so you would change <CODE>/mnt/store</CODE>
to <CODE>/var/video</CODE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% su
# mkdir /var/video
# chmod a+rwx /var/video
# exit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The <CODE>settings.txt</CODE> file is fairly self-explanatory.  </P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: although the width and height can be changed to almost
anything, if you start mythtv and don't see video, it is likely that the
video4linux (v4l) subsystem did not like the height and width parameters
specified.  It's best to leave the default as-is until you're sure that
mythtv is operational.</P>
<P>Users in North America can now exit and save the file.  Users in other parts
of the world need to modify the first line and modify the XMLTVGrabber
variable to the correct grabber for their region.  <B>tv_grab_uk</B> for the
UK, etc.  Use the name from the xmltv directory.</P>

<H3>Adding support for an external tuner.</H3>

<P>mythtv supports changing the channel on an external tuner.  If you have
an external tuner, like a DirecTV or digital cable set top box, the
following command should be added to your settings.txt file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
str ExternalChannelCommand=/usr/local/bin/changechannel
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <B>changechannel</B> program is not supplied with mythtv, so this is
going to be dependant on what sort of external tuner you have.</P>
<P>Feel free to browse some of what sort of hardware is available at 
<A HREF="http://shop.store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/cablepacks.html">http://shop.store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/cablepacks.html</A>, or if
you wish to assemble your own, rather than purchase, the following may be
helpful: 
<A HREF="http://www.snapstream.com/products/irblaster/sonydss.htm">http://www.snapstream.com/products/irblaster/sonydss.htm</A> for cable
pinouts for RCA DSS receivers.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.2">Running setup.</A>
</H2>

<P>Now that you've edited your <CODE>settings.txt</CODE> file, it's time to run the
setup program and perform the initial configuration.</P>
<P>Open a shell, and switch to the setup directory:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% cd setup
% ./setup
% cd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The setup program will ask you a few questions and then proceed to run the
XMLTV grabber program.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.3">Running mythfilldatabase.</A>
</H2>

<P>Now that the setup program has completed, run <B>mythfilldatabase</B> to
get one week of data inserted into the database.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  <B>mythfilldatabase</B> might take a while to complete,
depending on any number of factors, most of which you can't control.  It's
best to just let the program run to completion.</P>
<P><B>mythfilldatabase --manual</B> is another option; the manual option will
allow you to fine tune channel frequencies  and specify which channels will be added to
the database.</P>


<H3>Setting <B>mythfilldatabase</B> to run from <B>cron</B></H3>

<P>In order to keep your database filled, <B>mythfilldatabase</B> should be
run once a day.</P>
<P>The default <B>mythcrontab</B> file will run the <B>mythfilldatabase</B>
program every day at 0430.  If you want to change this, then open the
<CODE>configfiles/mythcrontab</CODE> file in your favorite editor and modify it
as you like.  Once you're satisfied with the time that
<B>mythfilldatabase</B> will run, save and exit, and return to the shell
prompt.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

% cd configfiles
% crontab mythcrontab
% crontab -l  NOTE: this is a lowercase L.
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - edit the master and reinstall.
# (mythcrontab installed on Mon Nov 11 20:36:28 2002)
# (Cron version -- $Id$)
# The following will run the mythfilldatabase shell script at 18:00 every

# In the case of mythfilldatabase, we want it to run at 0430 daily.

</P>
<P>As you can see, <B>mythfilldatabase</B> will now be run at 0430
every day.</P>
<P>If you decide to alter the time that the <B>mythfilldatabase</B> runs,
you can use the crontab command to open your existing job and edit it in
place.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% crontab -e
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <B>crontab -e</B> command will allow you to edit the existing crontab. 
<B>NOTE</B>:  By default, the crontab will use <B>vi</B> as your
editor.  If you don't like to use <B>vi</B>, make sure that you've set
<CODE>VISUAL</CODE> to something other than <B>vi</B>.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% export VISUAL=/usr/bin/joe
% crontab -e
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This will cause <B>crontab</B> to use <B>joe</B>, a visual editor that
uses the Wordstar command sequence.  You may use <B>emacs</B>, or any
other editor that you're comfortable with.  You may also add the
<CODE>EXPORT</CODE> command to your <CODE>.bashrc</CODE> or to the
<CODE>/etc/profile.d/mythtv.sh</CODE> file.</P>
<P>Once you've completed this step, run the <B>mythepg</B> program to check
that the database has been filled.  The cursor keys will move you around the
grid, the "I" key will give you more information on a program and ESC will
exit out back to the shell.</P>
