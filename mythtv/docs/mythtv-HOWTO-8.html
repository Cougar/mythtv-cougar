<H2><A NAME="s8">8.</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8">Setting up a remote control.</A></H2>

<P>MythTV does not have native remote control receiver and decoder software
built-in.  Instead, remote control functions are implemented by cooperating
with <B>lirc</B>, the Linux Infra Red Control program.  <B>lirc</B>
handles the IR hardware and passes keystrokes to MythTV, which then acts as
if the user had pressed the keys on the keyboard.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:If you are running Mandrake 9.1, you may install
<B>lirc</B> by executing: <CODE># urpmi lirc lirc-remotes</CODE> and bypass
the manual compilation steps described below by jumping to the 
<A HREF="#completing_lirc_install">Completing the lirc install</A> section. 
See the contrib/mandrake91.etc.sysconfig.lircd file for an example of how to
configure lircd.</P>
<P>Some IR devices require a kernel recompile, and some don't. However, all at
least require having the kernel source available as a resource for the lirc
build process. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.1">Gentoo</A>
</H2>

<P>To install lirc on Gentoo, all you need to do is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.2">Mandrake 9.0</A>
</H2>

<P>lircd has two prerequisites:  <B>dialog</B>, available in Mandrake
through the "cdialog" RPM, and the kernel source.  Mandrake 9.0 is using the
2.4.19 kernel, so either install the kernel sources from the installation CD
or go to 
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</A> and
download the full 2.4.19 tar file from 
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.3">Red Hat Linux 8.0</A>
</H2>

<P>You should already have the source from the "Kernel Development" package
you installed in section 3.2. Ensure that a symlink has been created:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cd /usr/src
$ su
# ln -s linux-2.4.18-x.x.x linux
# exit
</PRE>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.4">Obtaining and compiling lirc.</A>
</H2>

<P>You're going to need to download and compile lircd.  Go to 
<A HREF="http://www.lirc.org">http://www.lirc.org</A> and download lirc; as
of 2002-11-07, the version available is 0.6.6.  Grab the remotes.tgz file as
well. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ tar -xjf lirc-0.6.6.tar.bz2
$ cd lirc-0.6.6
$ ./setup.sh
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You're going to need to know what sort of receiver you have and where it's
connected.  In the case of the Pinnacle Studio TV card, with the IR receiver
connected to COM1 (/dev/ttys0), once the configuration menu comes up,
perform the configuration by going to Driver Configuration->Other Serial
Port Devices->Pinnacle Systems Receiver->OK and on the next page select
COM1->OK.</P>
<P>Each remote is different; some remote receivers connect directly to your
capture card and not to a serial port, so make sure that you've got the
correct one.</P>
<P>You then click "Save Configuration and run configure" to continue.</P>
<P>Make sure you read the last text generated by the configure step. It will
tell you if you require a kernel recompile, and what the name of your kernel
module will be (if necessary). For instance a home-built receiver may
require a kernel recompile, so you would be notified that you will have to
load the lirc_serial module. If you did not get any such messages skip the
kernel recompile steps below and go directly to making and installing the
lirc driver.</P>
<P>Once the configuration step is complete:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ make
$ su
# make install
# chmod 666 /dev/lircd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>At this point, if you're using a serial receiver, check that the link has
been correctly made in <CODE>/dev</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ ls -l /dev/li*
lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            5 Jan 27 09:00 /dev/lirc -> ttyS0
srw-rw-rw-    1 root     root            0 Jan 27 15:01 /dev/lircd=
prw-r--r--    1 root     root            0 Jan 27 09:00 /dev/lircm|
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>As you can see, there's a link from /dev/lirc to ttyS0, aka "COM1".</P>
<P>If the link was not created, ensure that you ran the <CODE>make install</CODE>
step as root.  If it still doesn't work, then you must create the link
manually.  In this example, the IR device is connected to ttyS0.  If it were
connected to "COM2", then use ttyS1, etc.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# cd /dev
# ln -sf ttyS0 lirc
# exit
$
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  The above example assumes that your receiver uses the
standard serial driver.  Some receivers do not, including receivers that
plug into a TV capture card.  Check the lirc documentation, but it may be
necessary to replace the link created above with a a character pipe:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mknod /dev/lirc c 61 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>See the lirc documentation for additional information.  The lirc
installation <EM>should</EM> create this for you, so manually creating it
indicates that your lirc installation may have other issues.</P>

<H3>Recompiling your kernel on Red Hat Linux</H3>

<P>Don't Panic! Red Hat makes a kernel recompile very easy. They provide  
configuration files that make it so you can recompile your kernel with  
Red Hat defaults. And as a side benefit, your kernel will be compiled  
specifically for your architecture. For a more detailed description (or  
if you run into trouble) of how to do this go to  
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/custom-guide/ch-custom-kernel.html">http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/custom-guide/ch-custom-kernel.html</A></P>
<P>For the impatient:
Make sure you have an emergency floppy boot disk available!
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cd /usr/src/linux
$ su
# make mrproper
# cd configs
# ls
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>at this point you must look at the file names and determine which  
config file is right for you. For instance if you have an Athlon XP you  
should choose "kernel-2.4.18-athlon.config" but if you have a dual  
processor P4 you might choose "kernel-2.4.18-i686-smp.config"
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cp yourconfig.config ../.config
# cd ../
# make xconfig
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>At this point you will get a graphical configuration utility. All that  
you must do to make lirc work is go to the "character devices" section  
and change "Standard/generic (8250/16550 and compatible UARTs) serial  
support" from "y" to "m". Now if you want you can have a look around.  
For instance, you might wish to turn off ham radio support, or perhaps  
turn off pcmcia support if you are not on a laptop. But be careful!  
Only change things you know you can change. If you are not sure, just  
stick to the one required change. Click "save and exit".

<P>if you are using <B>grub</B>, that should be it, reboot and select your custom

<P><B>NOTE to Mandrake 9.1 users</B>: skip to the manual start paragraph
below.</P>
<P>If the lirc configure program / compile did not mention anything about a
kernel module, then you are finished. If it did mention a kernel module, you
must edit the <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> file. Add this line as the first
thing in the file.  It must come first, or it may not work.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<PRE>
$ su

</P>
<P>Next, we're going to manually start lircd the first time.  Mandrake 9.1
users, type: <CODE># /etc/rc.d/init.d/lircd start</CODE> instead of:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /usr/local/sbin/lircd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If this fails, complaining of a missing <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file, then you
must find or make one. First look for a premade configuration file at 
<A HREF="http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/">http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/</A>.  Mandrake 9.1 users, look in
<CODE>/usr/share/lirc-remotes</CODE>. If you find one your remotes either on the
website or in <CODE>/usr/share</CODE>, download or copy the file, name it
<CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> and put it in your <CODE>/etc</CODE> directory. If you
couldn't find your remote, you must make your own <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file.</P>
<P>To make your own <CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irrecord myremote
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Follow the on-screen directions to train your remote and define keys. If  
your remote ends up working well, you should consider submitting your  
<CODE>lircd.conf</CODE> file back to the lirc developers. Once finished:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# cp myremote /etc/lircd.conf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>now try to start lircd again:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /usr/local/sbin/lircd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now, we're going to add the commands necessary for lircd to run each time we
boot. Mandrake 9.1 users, you can execute:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# chkconfig --level 35 lircd on
# exit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>All other distributions:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cd /etc/rc.d
# cat >> rc.local
echo "Starting lircd"
/usr/local/sbin/lircd
^D
# exit
$ 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 </P>
<P>This takes care of the lircd portion, which "listens" for the IR signals. If
everything went well, the install script for lircd put an appropriate
configuration file for your remote into <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> This file
maps the buttons on the remote control to the IR pulses coming from the
receiver.</P>
<P>The next step is to convert those signals into something that can be used
to control MythTV.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cd ~/mythtv-0.8/configfiles
$ cp lircrc.example ~/.lircrc

or
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cp lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv ~/.lircrc
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

if you've got a Pinnacle Studio PCTV remote.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irw
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Start pressing the keys on your remote; <B>irw</B> will
print the name of the button as it is defined in your
<CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE>. If you don't see anything at this point, you need
to troubleshoot further by going back to the lirc home page and investigating
from there.</P>
<P>If it is working, then press <B>CTRL-C</B> to abort the program.  Once you
know that your remote is working, you need to run the <B>irxevent</B>
program, which takes the key presses and sends them to MythTV. 
<B>irxevent</B>
isn't a daemon, so if you know that your remote is working you need to
invoke it like this: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irxevent &amp;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If <B>irxevent</B> isn't running, then MythTV will not respond to your remote
control.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.6">Additional information for lirc.</A>
</H2>

<P>Take a look at the lircrc.example files in the <CODE>configfiles/</CODE>
directory.  In my case, (Pinnacle Studio card) the channel up and down functions
weren't working, due to the fact that the button names were different than
the default <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file that came with MythTV.</P>
<P>The <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file has this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = ChannelUp
    config = Key Up CurrentWindow
end

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = ChannelDown
    config = Key Down CurrentWindow
end
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

but the <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> that comes in the lircd package 
defines the buttons for the Pinnacle Studio PCTV as:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          channel+                 0x0000000000000017
          channel-                 0x000000000000001C
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

rather than "ChannelUp" and "ChannelDown".  I added the 
following to my /home/[yourusername]/.lircrc file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = channel+
    repeat = 3
    config = Key Up CurrentWindow
end

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = channel-
    repeat = 3
    config = Key Down CurrentWindow
end
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

which took care of basic functionality.  Because the PCTV Studio remote
has additional buttons, look at the
<CODE>configfiles/lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv</CODE> for an example of how
to define additional buttons, and how to debug potential button name
conflicts between the <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file and how <B>your</B>
remote defines the button names.</P>
<P>By examining the button names defined in <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> and using
the <B>irw</B> program to make sure that your remote is working, you can
create the appropriate mappings in <CODE>.lircrc</CODE> to get excellent remote
functionality with MythTV.</P>
<P>Note the <B>repeat =</B> parameter.  This informs the <CODE>irxevent</CODE>
program to pass through every third keypress.  By default, <CODE>lirc</CODE>
will only send one keypress to the application, even if you're holding down
the key.  The actual <B>repeat =</B> number will vary from system to
system, so experiment and see which value works best for you.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.7">8.7</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.7">Configuring lirc for use with an IR blaster.</A>
</H2>

<P>By Carlos Talbot, 
<A HREF="mailto:carlos@talbot.net">mailto:carlos@talbot.net</A></P>
<P>Lirc has support for various IR transmitters. A popular model is the Actisys
IR-200L 
<A HREF="http://store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/irblasbun.html">http://store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/irblasbun.html</A>. It was
originally designed for IRDA communication, but can be used to transmit A/V remote
control codes. By using the lirc SIR driver, this device can easily be
integrated with MythTV. I have tested this device with an AT&amp;T DCT2000
digital cable box but the instructions can be used to configure other IRDA
devices and A/V remotes.</P>
<P>Follow the steps in the previous section.  When you run setup.sh, select
option 1, driver configuration. From here select option 6, IrDA hardware.
Select your appropriate device and the corresponding serial port, then Save
configuration &amp; run configure from the main menu. Once configure is done
type:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ make
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Please note: unlike the Pinnacle receiver above you will be compiling lircd
in addition to a kernel module for the SIR transmitter. Depending on whether
you have your serial port driver configured as a kernel module you might see
the following message during make:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
lirc_sir.c:56:2: warning: #warning
"******************************************"

lirc_sir.c:57:2: warning: #warning "Your serial port driver is compiled into "

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you do receive this statement make sure to run the <B>setserial</B> command
before you load the lirc_sir module. Follow this with the install:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You will notice that lirc installs the kernel module in
<CODE>/lib/modules/uname -a/misc</CODE>. </P>
<P>The configuration for starting <B>lircd</B> differs if you're going to be
sending and receiving IR versus just receiving.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 
# cd /etc/rc.d

modprobe lirc_sir
/usr/local/sbin/lircd
^D
# exit
$ 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>At this point you have to populate the <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> file with the proper
codes for your A/V remote. You should be able to find your remote within the
lirc remote tar file located at 
<A HREF="http://www.lirc.org/remotes.tar.bz2">http://www.lirc.org/remotes.tar.bz2</A>. In my case I
extracted the file from remotes/motorola/DCT2000 (gi-motorola-dct2000)</P>
<P>To test the lirc_sir module you can run <B>irw</B> to verify the codes are being
received. If everything is configured correctly
you should see something similar to the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irw
0000000000007ff0 00 1 gi-motorola-dct2000
000000000000bff8 00 2 gi-motorola-dct2000
000000000000f7f0 00 ENTER gi-motorola-dct2000
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Once you've verified lirc is working you can press <B>CTRL-C</B> to exit
<B>irw</B> and configure the channel changing script.</P>
<P>The path to the channel changing script will need to be entered on the
mythbackend setup screen for Input Connections.</P>
<P>This csh script will be called each time MythTV needs to change the channel.
Below is a copy of the script followed by the corresponding perl script.
Make sure both are in your path. Also make sure you leave the #!/bin/csh
setting and not change it to bourne or bash. This will create a frustrating
symptom to diagnose where MythTV cannot open /dev/device. Unlike bourne or
bash, csh scripts automatically close parent file descriptors before they
start.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cd /usr/local/bin
# su
# cat > change_channel.csh
#!/bin/csh
echo "changing to $1"
/usr/local/bin/channel.pl $1 &amp;
^D
# chmod a+x change_channel.csh
# exit
$ exit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>See <CODE>contrib/channel.pl</CODE> for the actual file.  Copy it to
<CODE>/usr/local/bin/</CODE></P>
<P>The last statement within the perl script is the lirc rc command. This is
the command that transmits the code to your cable/dss box. Make sure to have
the IRDA device within a few feet of the box.</P>
