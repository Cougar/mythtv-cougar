<P>mythtv does not have native remote control receiver and decoder software
built-in.  Instead, remote control functions are implemented by cooperating
with lirc, the Linux Infra Red Control program.  lirc handles the IR
hardware and passes keystrokes to mythtv, which then acts as if the user had
pressed the keys on the keyboard.</P>
<P>lircd has two prerequisites:  dialog, available in Mandrake through the
"cdialog" RPM, and the kernel source.  Mandrake 9.0 is using the 2.4.19
kernel, so the easiest thing is to go to 
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</A> and download
the full 2.4.19 tar file from 
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.1">Obtaining the kernel.</A>
</H2>

<P>An easy way is to use the wget command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.19.tar.bz2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Next, open a shell and login as superuser.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su 
# mkdir /usr/src
# mv linux-2.4.19.tar.bz2 /usr/src
# cd /usr/src
# tar -xjf linux-2.4.19.tar.bz2
# chown -R root.root linux-2.4.19
# ln -sf linux-2.4.19 linux
# exit

</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.2">Obtaining and compiling lirc.</A>
</H2>

<P>You're going to need to download and compile lircd.  Go to 
<A HREF="http://www.lirc.org">http://www.lirc.org</A> and download lirc; as
of 2002-11-07, the version available is 0.6.6.  Grab the remotes.tgz file as
well. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ tar -xjf lirc-0.6.6.tar.bz2
$ cd lirc-0.6.6
$ ./setup.sh
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You're going to need to know what sort of receiver you have and where
it's connected.  In my case, I have a Pinnacle Studio TV card, with the IR
receiver connected to COM1 (/dev/ttys0), so once the configuration menu came
up I did Driver Configuration->Other Serial Port Devices->Pinnacle Systems
Receiver->OK and on the next page selected COM1->OK.</P>
<P>Each remote is different; some remote receivers connect directly to your
capture card and not to a serial port, so make sure that you've got the
correct one.</P>

<P>You then click "Save Configuration and run configure" to continue.</P>
<P>Once the configuration step is complete:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ make
$ su
# make install
# chmod 666 /dev/lircd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Next, we're going to manually start lircd the first time:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# /usr/local/sbin/lircd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Now, we're going to add the commands necessary for lircd to run each time
we boot:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# cd /etc/rc.d
# cat >> rc.local
echo "Starting lircd"
/usr/local/sbin/lircd
^D
# exit
%
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 This takes care of the lircd portion, which "listens" for
the IR signals. If everything went well, the install script for lircd put an
appropriate configuration file for your remote into <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> This
file maps the buttons on the remote control to the IR pulses coming from the
receiver.</P>
<P>The next step is to convert those signals into something that can be used
to control mythtv.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cd ~/mythtv-0.7/configfiles
$ cp lircrc.example ~/.lircrc
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 
or
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cp lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv ~/.lircrc
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

if you've got a Pinnacle Studio PCTV remote.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irw
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Start pressing the keys on your remote; <B>irw</B> will
print the name of the button as it is defined in your
<CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE>. If you don't see anything at this point, you need
to troubleshoot further by going back to the lirc home page and investigating
from there.</P>
<P>If it is working, then press <B>CTRL-C</B> to abort the program.  Once you
know that your remote is working, you need to run the <B>irxevent</B>
program, which takes the key presses and sends them to mythtv. 
<B>irxevent</B>
isn't a daemon, so if you know that your remote is working you need to
invoke it like this: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irxevent &amp;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If <B>irxevent</B> isn't running, then mythtv will not respond to your remote
control.</P>
<P>Currently, mythtv doesn't have native support for controlling the mixer
volume and mute settings.  A workaround at this time is to invoke the
<B>amixer</B> program.  If you wish to define keys to control the mixer,
the <B>irexec</B> program can accomplish this fairly easily.  The
configfiles/lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv file has an example of calling
an external program from a remote control button.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.3">Additional information for lirc.</A>
</H2>

<P>Take a look at the lircrc.example files in the <CODE>configfiles/</CODE>
directory.  In my case, (Pinnacle Studio card) the channel up and down functions
weren't working, due to the fact that the button names were different than
the default <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file that came with mythtv.</P>
<P>The <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file has this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = ChannelUp
    config = Key Up CurrentWindow
end

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = ChannelDown
    config = Key Down CurrentWindow
end
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

but the <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> that comes in the lircd package 
defines the buttons for the Pinnacle Studio PCTV as:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
          channel+                 0x0000000000000017
          channel-                 0x000000000000001C
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

rather than "ChannelUp" and "ChannelDown".  I added the 
following to my /home/[yourusername]/.lircrc file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = channel+
    config = Key Up CurrentWindow
end

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = channel-
    config = Key Down CurrentWindow
end
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

which took care of basic functionality.  Because the PCTV Studio remote
has additional buttons, look at the
<CODE>configfiles/lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv</CODE> for an example of how
to define additional buttons, and how to debug potential button name
conflicts between the <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file and how <B>your</B>
remote defines the button names.</P>
<P>By examining the button names defined in <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> and using
the <B>irw</B> program to make sure that your remote is working, you can
create the appropriate mappings in <CODE>.lircrc</CODE> to get excellent remote
functionality with mythtv.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc8.4">Configuring lirc for use with an IR blaster.</A>
</H2>

<P>By Carlos Talbot, 
<A HREF="mailto:carlos@talbot.net">mailto:carlos@talbot.net</A></P>
<P>Lirc has support for various IR transmitters. A popular model is the Actisys
IR-200L 
<A HREF="http://store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/irblasbun.html">http://store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/irblasbun.html</A>. It was
originally designed for IRDA communication, but can be used to transmit A/V remote
control codes. By using the lirc SIR driver, this device can easily be
integrated with mythtv. I have tested this device with an AT&amp;T DCT2000
digital cable box but the instructions can be used to configure other IRDA
devices and A/V remotes.</P>
<P>Follow the steps in the previous section.  When you run setup.sh, select
option 1, driver configuration. From here select option 6, IrDA hardware.
Select your appropriate device and the corresponding serial port, then Save
configuration &amp; run configure from the main menu. Once configure is done
type:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ make
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Please note: unlike the Pinnacle receiver above you will be compiling lircd
in addition to a kernel module for the SIR transmitter. Depending on whether
you have your serial port driver configured as a kernel module you might see
the following message during make:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
lirc_sir.c:56:2: warning: #warning
"******************************************"

lirc_sir.c:57:2: warning: #warning "Your serial port driver is compiled into "

lirc_sir.c:58:2: warning: #warning "the kernel. You will have to release the "

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you do receive this statement make sure to run the <B>setserial</B> command
before you load the lirc_sir module. Follow this with the install:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You will notice that lirc installs the kernel module in
<CODE>/lib/modules/uname -a/misc</CODE>. </P>
<P>The configuration for starting <B>lircd</B> differs if you're going to be
sending and receiving IR versus just receiving.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 
# cd /etc/rc.d
# cat >> rc.local
echo "Starting lircd"
setserial /dev/ttySx uart none        # (if required)
modprobe lirc_sir
/usr/local/sbin/lircd
^D
# exit
%
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>At this point you have to populate the <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> file with the proper
codes for your A/V remote. You should be able to find your remote within the
lirc remote tar file located at 
<A HREF="http://www.lirc.org/remotes.tar.bz2">http://www.lirc.org/remotes.tar.bz2</A>. In my case I
extracted the file from remotes/motorola/DCT2000 (gi-motorola-dct2000)</P>
<P>To test the lirc_sir module you can run <B>irw</B> to verify the codes are being
received. If everything is configured correctly
you should see something similar to the following:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irw
0000000000007ff0 00 1 gi-motorola-dct2000
000000000000bff8 00 2 gi-motorola-dct2000
000000000000f7f0 00 ENTER gi-motorola-dct2000
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Once you've verified lirc is working you can press <B>CTRL-C</B> to exit
<B>irw</B> and configure the channel changing script.</P>
<P>Within <CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv/settings.txt</CODE>  (or
<CODE>~/.mythtv/settings.txt</CODE>) you
need to add the following line:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
str ExternalChannelCommand=/usr/local/bin/change_channel
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This csh script will be called each time mythtv needs to change the channel.
Below is a copy of the script followed by the corresponding perl script.
Make sure both are in your path. Also make sure you leave the #!/bin/csh
setting and not change it to bourne or bash. This will create a frustrating
symptom to diagnose where mythtv cannot open /dev/device. Unlike bourne or
bash, csh scripts automatically close parent file descriptors before they
start.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cd /usr/local/bin
# su
# cat > change_channel.csh
#!/bin/csh
echo "changing to $1"
/usr/local/bin/channel.pl $1 &amp;
^D
# chmod a+x change_channel.csh
# exit
$ exit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The following file should be saved as /usr/local/bin/channel.pl
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#!/usr/bin/perl
 
# make sure to set this string to
# the corresponding remote in /etc/lircd.conf
$remote_name = "gi-motorola-dct2000";   
 
sub change_channel {
        my($channel_digit) = @_;
        system ("rc SEND_ONCE $remote_name $channel_digit");
        sleep 1;
}
 
$channel=$ARGV[0];
sleep 1;
if (length($channel) > 2) {
        change_channel(substr($channel,0,1));
        change_channel(substr($channel,1,1));
        change_channel(substr($channel,2,1));
} elsif (length($channel) > 1) {
        change_channel(substr($channel,0,1));
        change_channel(substr($channel,1,1));
} else {
        change_channel(substr($channel,0,1));
}
system ("rc SEND_ONCE $remote_name ENTER");
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The last statement within the perl script is the lirc rc command. This is
the command that transmits the code to your cable/dss box. Make sure to have
the IRDA device within a few feet of the box.</P>
