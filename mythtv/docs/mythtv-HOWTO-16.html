<P>The MythWeather module will obtain the weather information for the
location that you specify.  You must be running MythTV v0.8 in order to use
MythWeather.</P>

<PRE>
NOTE for Red Hat Linux 8.0 users: Red Hat 8 users must make the following
modification, or several weather icons will fail to be installed.

From the mythweather build directory move to the mythweather sub-directory
and edit the Makefile there.

Find and comment out (using a '#' symbol) the following line:

strip "$(INSTALL_ROOT)/usr/local/share/mythtv/mythweather/images/"
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>Change into the MythWeather directory, then make and make install:

$ cd mythweather
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit

</P>
<P>MythWeather uses MSNBC.com as its source for weather data and weather.com
for its radar image.</P>
<P>These are the keyboard commands for MythWeather:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Left Key             Goes back one page, and extends the time spent
                     on the page you are on.
Right Key            Goes forward one page, see above.
Space                Pause, wait on the current page until space is hit
                     again.
Numeric Keys         You can check other weather by keying in other ZIP codes.
Enter Key            Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Can also
                     be used a way to force a data update.
"m" Key              Resets the location to the database default, then updates the data.
"i"                  Enter / Save settings
ESC                  Exit the settings screen without saving / Exit the program
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>MythWeather also has an "Aggressiveness" setting.  This affects how long
MythWeather waits for data from the msnbc.com website before timing out.  If
you are on a slow connection, or have a slow DNS, or MythWeather just
doesn't seem to be working and you've already tried everything else, then
try increasing the aggressiveness level parameter.  This parameter is
inverse; a higher number actually means that MythWeather will be less
aggressive, and will therefore wait longer before timing out.</P>
<P>MythWeather will print debugging information on the terminal.  If you wish
to see additional debugging information while MythWeather is running, run
mythweather from the command line with as <CODE>mythweather --debug</CODE></P>
<P>You may also force mythweather to re-run the configuration by starting it on
the command line as <CODE>mythweather --configure</CODE>.  These two options are
mutually exclusive.</P>
