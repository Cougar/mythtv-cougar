<P>There are a few ways of installing programs on Linux systems; you can either
use the graphical tools, or command-line utilities.  Either system will get
the job done, and it all depends on your comfort level with Linux.</P>
<P>In order to compile mythtv, we need to make sure that the software it
needs is installed.  As of 2002-11-08, this list includes perl-5.8, mysql,
gcc, freetype2-devel and qt-devel.  If you're going to use a remote control
with mythtv, you're going to need the cdialog package in order to compile
lircd.</P>

</H2>

<P>On systems running KDE, a tool which will allow you to see what packages
are available and if they're installed on your system can be accessed by
clicking K->Configuration->Packaging->KPackage</P>
<P>There are many inter-related modules, so make sure that you've got the
main package for each one, and not a sub package for an unrelated item.  For
example, there are many modules that have "perl" in them; some are a part of
the apache web server, others are a part of the perl distribution.  In each
case, we're looking to make sure that the primary module is getting
installed.</P>
<P>Click the magnifying glass or press <B>CTRL-F</B> and enter "perl" as your
search term.  You should find it under the "Perl" folder.  You need at least
the perl 5.80 base package installed.  If not, click on the "Mark" button.</P>
<P>Next, search for mysql - it should be under "Databases".  Make sure that
mysql and mysql-clients are installed.  If not, click on "Mark".</P>
<P>Search for gcc.  You're going to need gcc and gcc-c++ installed.</P>
<P>Search for freetype2.  Make sure that you've got freetype2 and
freetype2-devel installed.</P>
<P>Finally, check for qt.  You'll need libqt3-devel (under folder "KDE and
Qt") and libqt3 ("Libraries").</P>
<P>Make sure that cdialog is installed if you want to use mythtv with a remote
control.</P>
<P>alsa-utils is needed for setting the volume.</P>
<P>If you marked anything to install, click on Install Marked.  Click "Yes" or
OK if you get a message about satisfying dependencies.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc2.2">Command-line installation.</A>
</H2>

<P> This section details the various methods for installing pre-requisites
from the command line.</P>

<H3>Mandrake 8.2 and 9.0</H3>

<P>The simplest tool for installing packages from the command line is
<B>urpmi</B>.</P>
<P>Open a shell, and execute the following, all on the same line:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% su -
# urpmi perl-5.8 mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel libqt3-devel cdialog
alsa-utils
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You may get asked a number of questions regarding dependencies.  It's best
to answer "YES".</P>
<P>However, you might get this when you execute the command above:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[root@pvr root]# urpmi perl-5.8 mysql gcc gcc-c++
freetype2-devel libqt3-devel cdialog
everything already installed
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In that case, you're ready to move onto the next step.</P>
