<abstract>
Initially, installation of MythTV seems like a huge task.  There are lots
of dependencies, and various distributions seem to do the same thing
different ways.  This document will attempt to give general installation
instructions, as well as including distribution-specific instructions where
necessary.
</abstract>
<toc>
<sect>First things first.
<sect1>What is MythTV?
<p>MythTV is a suite of programs that allow you to build the mythical home
media convergence box on your own using Open Source software and operating
systems.

MythTV has a number of capabilities.  The television portion allows you to
do the following:
<itemize>
<item>You may pause, fast-forward and rewind live Television.
<item>You may install multiple video capture cards to record more than one
program at a time.
<item>You can have multiple servers, each with multiple capture cards in
them.  All servers are centrally managed and all programs are scheduled by the
Master backend.
<item>You can have multiple clients (called "frontends" in MythTV parlance),
each with a common view of all available programs.  Any client can watch any
program that was recorded by any of the servers.  Clients can be diskless
and controlled entirely by a remote control.
<item>You may use any combination of standard analog capture card, MPEG-2,
MJPEG, DVB or HDTV capture devices.  With appropriate hardware, MythTV can
control set top boxes, often found in digital cable and satellite TV
systems.
<item>Program Guide Data in North America is downloaded from Zap2It.com, a
subsidiary of Tribune Media Services.  This free service is called
DataDirect, and provides MythTV almost two weeks of scheduling information. 
Program Guide Data in other countries is obtained using XMLTV.  MythTV uses
this information to create a schedule that maximizes the number of programs
that can be recorded if you don't have enough tuners.
</itemize> 
Other modules in MythTV include:
<itemize>
<item>MythGallery, a picture-viewing application
<item>MythVideo, a media-viewer for content not created within MythTV
<item>MythDVD, a DVD viewer / ripper
<item>MythMusic, a music playing / ripping application which supports MP3
and FLAC
<item>MythGame
<item>MythWeather
<item>MythNews, a RSS news grabber
<item>MythBrowser, a web browser
<item>MythWeb, which allows you to control your MythTV system using a web
browser.  With MythWeb, you can schedule recordings, delete files, change
keybindings and more.  With proper security, you may even schedule a program
over the Internet and have it immediately acted on by the scheduler.
<item>MythPhone, phone and videophone using SIP.
</itemize>
<sect1>QuickStart
<p>Custom mini-distributions are available to make it easier to install
MythTV.  A mini-distribution removes many of the "general purpose"
workstation / server software packages that may be installed by default if
you use one of the big-name OS packages.

See <url url="http://mysettopbox.tv" name="http://mysettopbox.tv"> if you'd
like to install a custom version of Knoppix optimized for MythTV.

See <url url="http://linpvr.org/" name="http://linpvr.org/"> if you'd like
to install MythTV onto a VIA Epia M machine.

like to install MythTV on an XBox.

See <url url="http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/"
name="http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/"> for instructions tailored to RedHat's
Fedora Core distribution.
<sect1>Upgrading from previous versions.
<p>The upgrade from previous versions should be transparent.  Any changes to
the database structure should be applied automatically.

It is <em>strongly</em> recommended that you back up your database before
installing a new version of MythTV.

<sect>Introduction.
<p>This HOWTO document will focus on manually building MythTV in a North
American environment. If you have installation instructions for a different
region or Linux distribution, please send them to the author so that it can
be included in other versions of this document.

<sect>Checking prerequisites. 
<p>You must ensure that any firewalls (either hardware, or a software
firewall installed by your distribution) will not block access to the ports
that will be used by the MythTV clients and servers on the "inside" LAN. 
The ports for MySQL (TCP port 3306) and mythbackend (TCP ports 6543 and
6544) must be open.  It is <em>strongly</em> recommended that you do
<em>not</em> expose the MythTV and MySQL ports to the Internet or your
"Outside" LAN.

<sect1>Hardware
<p>Hardware selection is a complex topic, one this HOWTO will only discuss
briefly and in general terms. The following subsections offer some general 
guidance but stop short of offering specific recommendations.

For more detail about actual configurations that others have used, Mark
Cooper has setup a hardware database at <url
url="http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/" name="http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/">. The
website will let you browse what other users have reported as their hardware
configuration, and how happy they are with the results.

If you have specific questions about the suitability of specific hardware
choices, you can consult the archives of the mythtv-users mailing list at
<url url="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/"
name="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/"> or
post a question to the list.
<sect2>CPU Type and Speed
<p>Selection of CPU type and speed is one of the trickiest elements of
hardware selection, mainly because there are so many tradeoffs which can be
made.  For example, if you have plenty of CPU, you can use higher bitrates
or capture sizes, etc.

MythTV has two modes of operation.  First, it can function as a software video
encoder, which means that it uses a fairly generic "dumb" video capture card
to get frames of video, encodes them using the CPU on your motherboard and
writes them to disk.  High-end video capture cards and devices like the TiVo
and ReplayTV have dedicated encoder chips which use specialized hardware to
convert the video stream to the MPEG-2 format without using the motherboard
CPU.  The main CPU has the responsibility of running the Operating System
and reading and writing the encoded frames to the disk.  These tasks have
fairly low CPU requirements compared to encoding video, which is why a
device like a Series 1 TiVo can run with only 16MB of RAM and a 54MHz CPU.

There are many variables that go into the question: "How fast a CPU do I
need to run MythTV"?  Obviously, the faster your CPU, the better your
experience will be with MythTV.  If you are using the software MPEG-4
encoder and performing the "Watch TV" function, where the CPU is both
encoding and decoding video simultaneously to allow Pause, Fast Forward and
Rewind functions for live TV requires more CPU then just encoding or
decoding.  MythTV also supports multiple encoder cards in a single PC,
thereby increasing the CPU requirements if you plan on simultaneously
encoding multiple programs.  As a general guideline, plan on 1GHz per
encoder if you are doing software-based encoding, less if you are using a
hardware-based encoder.

Here are a few data points:
<itemize>
<item>A PIII/733MHz system can encode one video stream using the MPEG-4
codec using 480x480 capture resolution.  This does not allow for live TV
watching, but does allow for encoding video and then watching it later.
<item>A developer states that his AMD1800+ system can <bf>almost</bf>
encode two MPEG-4 video streams and watch one program simultaneously.
<item>A PIII/800MHz system with 512MB RAM can encode one video
stream using the RTjpeg codec with 480x480 capture resolution and play it back
simultaneously, thereby allowing live TV watching.
<item>A dual Celeron/450MHz is able to view a 480x480 MPEG-4/3300kbps file
created on a different system with 30% CPU usage.
<item>A P4 2.4GHz machine can encode two 3300Kbps 480x480 MPEG-4 files and
simultaneously serve content to a remote frontend.
</itemize>

The second mode of operation is where MythTV is paired with a hardware-based
video encoder, such as a Matrox G200 or a Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-250/350.  In
this mode, because the video encoding is being done by a dedicated video
processor, the host CPU requirements are quite low.  See the <ref
id="video_capture_device" name="Video Capture Device"> section for details.

If you have a Via M10000 series or a Hauppauge PVR-350, MythTV can use the
hardware-based video decoder for playback, which further reduces CPU
requirements.

<sect2>Memory
<p>A MythTV host that is both a backend and a frontend and using software
encoding with a single capture card should run adequately in 256MB of RAM.
Additional RAM above 256MB will not necessarily increase performance, but
may be useful if you are running multiple encoders.

<sect2>Hard Disk(s)
<p>Encoded video takes up a lot of hard disk space. The exact amount depends
on the encoding scheme, the size of the raw images, and the frames per
second, but typical values for MythTV range from 700 megabytes/hour to 2
gigabyte/hour for MPEG-4 and larger for MPEG-2 and RTjpeg.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  You <em>must</em> use DMA for hard drive access to prevent
choppy or jittery video.  Not all distributions enable DMA at boot time. 
See the Troubleshooting Section for <ref id="Setting_DMA"
name="instructions"> on how to do this.</caption>
</figure>

Writing video to disk is sensitive to timing issues; RTjpeg requires less
CPU with the tradeoff being larger files and needing to write to the disk
faster.  MPEG-4 requires more CPU, but the files are smaller.  At the
default resolution, MPEG-2 creates the largest files of all with almost no
CPU impact.

See the Troubleshooting <ref id="Setting_DMA" name="section"> for more
information.

<sect2>Filesystems
<p>MythTV creates large files, many in excess of 2GB.  You <em>must</em> use a
filesystem that will allow you to create large files.  Filesystems known to
have problems with large files are FAT and FAT32.

Because MythTV creates very large files, a filesystem that does well at
deleting large files is important.  Numerous benchmarks show that XFS and
JFS do very well at this task.  You are strongly encouraged to consider
either of these for your MythTV filesystem.

Because of the size of the MythTV files, it may be useful to plan for future
expansion right from the beginning.  If your case and power supply have the
capacity for additional hard drives, read through the <ref id="LVM"
name="LVM"> and <ref id="advancedpartitionformatting" name="Advanced
Partition Formatting"> sections for some pointers.

<label id="video_capture_device">
<sect2>Video Capture Device 
<p>In order to capture video, MythTV will need one or more video capture
devices with Linux drivers.  There are a number of classes of hardware
available for capturing video.  
<sect3>Frame Grabbers.
<p>This class of card is the simplest and is usually the cheapest.  There is no
on-board encoding of the analog video; hardware known as a Digital-Analog
Converter (DAC) takes the video and presents it to the computer in an
essentially raw digital form.

For a list of video capture cards known to work with Linux, please see
<tt>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv</tt> for a partial
listing; even if your specific card is not listed, it may be that the vendor
is actually using a standard reference design and placing their own name on
it.  See the video4linux mailing list (<url
url="https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list"
name="https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list">) for
more information and for specific hardware questions.

The most common inexpensive cards available use the Bt848 or Bt878 video
capture chip; examples are the "Hauppauge WinTV Go" card and the "AverTV
Desktop PVR" card, both of which use the bttv kernel module.

<code>
NOTE:  The ATI TV Wonder series and the ATI All-in-Wonder series of cards
are not the same.  The All-in-Wonder cards will not work with MythTV.

drivers that are available provide only a limited subset of the V4L API. 
The TV Wonder series of cards are supported by the Bt8x8 Video4Linux driver.

Newer cards may use the CX23881 series of chips; a driver is available at
<url url="http://bytesex.org/cx88/" name="http://bytesex.org/cx88/">.

After you have installed a suitable capture device, you can check that 
the kernel sees it with <tt>lspci</tt>. Look for an entry labeled "Multimedia 
video controller". To get more detailed information about the card, use 
<tt>lspci -v</tt> or <tt>lspci -vv</tt>.  Ensure that your system is loading
the bttv modules by typing:
<tscreen><verb>
# lsmod |grep bttv
</verb></tscreen>

You want to see the <tt>bttv</tt> module listed.
<sect3>Hardware MPEG-2 encoders.
<p>While inexpensive video-capture cards simply capture raw frames, leaving
encoding to software, some higher-end cards incorporate hardware-based
encoding. Using either a G200 MJPEG encoder card, or a MPEG-2 encoder card
supported by the IvyTV project <url url="http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/"
name="http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/"> such as the Hauppauge PVR-250, PVR-350,
Avermedia M179, Hauppauge "Freestyle" or Yuan M600 cards will allow you to
use dedicated hardware encoders rather than your CPU. Release 0.17 of MythTV
is able to use these MPEG-2 encoders as an input device for live TV and for
scheduled recordings.  (The PVR-350 can simultaneously be used as an output
device.) Using the on-board MPEG-2 encoder drastically reduces the CPU
requirements for encoding.

Here are some data points for encoding:
<itemize>
<item>A Celeron 450 uses 2% CPU for encoding a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 stream.
</itemize>

Here are some data points for decoding:

<itemize>
<item>An Athlon 1800XP can decode a 720x480 8Mbps MPEG-2 file using 10% CPU
<item>An Athlon 1GHz can decode a 720x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file using 30-50%
CPU, can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 using 30% CPU and approximately 30%
for Live TV at 416x480.
<item>A P3-550 can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file with 55% CPU.
<item>A Celeron 450 (no SSE) can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file with
80% CPU.
</itemize>
See the <ref id="pvr250" name="Hauppauge PVR-250/350 hardware MPEG-2
encoder."> section for information on installing a PVR-250 on Mandrake 9.1. 
The information contained in the section will also apply to other MPEG-2
encoder cards supported by the IVTV driver.

<sect3>DVB capture cards.
<p>DVB is a video standard primarily found in Europe.  MythTV supports DVB;
see the pages maintained by Martin Smith <url
url="mailto:martin@ethics-gradient.net" name="martin@ethics-gradient.net">
at <url url="http://www.ethics-gradient.net/myth/mythdvb.html"
name="http://www.ethics-gradient.net/myth/mythdvb.html"> for more
information.  To see if your DVB card is supported, see the list of cards at
<url url="http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb/CARDS"
name="http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb/CARDS"> for more information.

In the United States, you may use a card such as the TwinHan to obtain
unencrypted Free-To-Air satellite channels.

<sect3>HDTV.
<p>Currently there are two HDTV card with Linux drivers which are known to
operate in the United States - the HD-2000 and HD-3000 cards available from
<url url="http://www.pchdtv.com/" name="http://www.pchdtv.com/"> and the
Air2PC-ATSC-PCI available from <url
url="http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=103"
name="http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=103">
or <url url="http://mythic.tv/" name="http://mythic.tv/">. The Air2PC card
can be configured to capture unencrypted QAM and 8VSB.  8VSB is the standard
used for over-the-air ATSC signals, QAM is used on cable TV systems.  The
Air2PC is supported using the linux-dvb drivers.

To playback HDTV content, plan on a powerful CPU.  "How powerful?" depends
on a number of factors, such as the capture resolution, whether the video is
progressive or interlaced, and whether your display card has hardware-assist
support for Linux. For 720p content (1280x720), a 2.4GHz P4 should be
sufficient.

For 1920x1080i->1920x1080p with the better deinterlacing methods
done in real time a 2.4GHz CPU is taxed, but should work if you use "Bob and
Weave" deinterlacing, or if you have an NVIDIA card with MPEG-2 hardware
accelleration.  If you enable the hardware accelleration, you may be able to
use a 1.8GHz processor.

<sect3>Firewire.
<p>You may use the Firewire output of the DCT6200 or the SA3250.

<sect2>Hardware known NOT to work and other issues
<p><itemize>
<item>Hauppauge WinTV-D or -HD (no driver)
<item>Hauppauge WinTV-USB series
<item>Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-usb, or PCI cards (no driver - this is not the PVR-250/350
series of cards supported by the IvyTV driver)
<item>Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-USB2 (driver available at http://justiceforall.free.fr/pvrusb2.html, no MythTV support)
<item>ATI All-in-Wonder series
</itemize>

There are no known consumer-level capture devices which will allow you to
capture the HDTV output (either DVI or HDMI) from a set-top box commonly
found with digital cable systems or satellite systems.

There are no known consumer-level capture devices which will allow you to
capture component output from a set-top box.
<sect2>Sound card
<p>The system needs a sound card or an on-board equivalent on the motherboard
to play back and in most cases, to record sound. Any sound card that can be
operated by the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) kernel modules will
work with MythTV.  However, some cards and drivers will provide better
quality or compatibility than others.  In particular, many audio
devices included on motherboards can be problematic.

The usual practice for capturing the audio associated with the video
is to run a cable from an audio output on the video capture card to
the Line input on a sound card. However, some video capture cards
provide on-board audio capabilities that work with the kernel
<tt>btaudio</tt> module instead, thereby eliminating the need for a
cable.  This is useful if you will be using multiple capture cards in
a single chassis, since each capture card will not need its own sound
card.  Note that a separate sound card is still required for playback
when using <tt>btaudio</tt>, and that often the audio recorded in this
way will be mono only.  See the <ref id="btaudio" name="btaudio">
section for more information.

<sect2>Video Display Card
<p>MythTV will work with just about any video card.  However, it is highly
recommended that you use a card which supports XVideo (XV) extensions. If
your card does not support XV, color conversion and scaling will be
performed by your CPU rather than the video card.  This is very CPU
and memory intensive and will often result in dropped frames and a
corresponding degradation of quality.  Check the XFree86 documentation
for details if you are uncertain about your preferred card.  You may
also run <tt>xvinfo</tt>; look for your video card to be listed as one
of the adapters.

<!-- Updated information  from "Ray Olszewski" <ray@comarre.com> -->

If you want to use MythTV with a standard television, you will need a
physical connection from your video card to your TV set, which can either be
a TV-out port on the card itself or an external adapter that converts the
VGA signal to an appropriate video signal. "Appropriate" depends on a number
of factors, such as video standard (NTSC vs PAL) type of input connection
(Composite vs SVideo), etc.

Note that with some video cards and X drivers, XVideo extensions are
only supported on the VGA output, and not on the TV output.

<sect2>Cards with TV out
<p>The next section deals with a number of cards that are known to have
TV-out ports.  The list is unlikely to be complete, so if you know of
others, please post a message to the mythtv-users mailing list so the
information can be included in future versions of the HOWTO. The list is
organized by manufacturer.

Reports here are based on what users of the cards have posted on the
mythtv-users mailing list, so if you need configuration details, please
search the archives at <url
url="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/"
name="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/"> using
the card name in your search string.

<sect3>ATI
<p>ATI makes many cards with TV-out capability, but ATI offers no official
support for their use with Linux. The standard XFree86 ati driver does not
support TV-out.

The enhanced ati.2 X driver created by the GATOS <url
url="http://gatos.sourceforge.net" name="http://gatos.sourceforge.net">
project offers some support for TV-out, but only in its "experimental"
version, available through CVS. There have been reports from people who say
they have made this driver work with one or another ATI card. For example,
Bruce Markey <url url="mailto:bjm@lvcm.com"> writes (on the mythtv-users
mailing list): "I got this to work. You can quote me on that. I've used
TV-out on several models of ATI cards both All-In-Wonder and regular cards
with TV-out." See the "Adventurous Setup" section of <url
url="http://gatos.sourceforge.net/watching_tv.php"

<p>The standard Matrox driver included with XFree86 does not support TV-out.

Older Matrox cards can be used with a proprietary X driver provided by 
Matrox, and it does simultaneously support TV out and XVideo on some cards. 
See <url url="http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/files/lnx_21.cfm"
name="http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/files/lnx_21.cfm"> for details.

Newer Matrox cards can be run with a set of kernel patches (for kernel 
2.4.19) and a customized X driver, but this arrangement does not support 
XVideo on TV-out. See 
<url url="http://www.bglug.ca/matrox_tvout/g450_tvout_howto.html"
name="http://www.bglug.ca/matrox_tvout/g450_tvout_howto.html"> for details.

Specific cards:
<itemize>
<item>Matrox G400 AGP. Uses external adapter to provide Composite and
SVideo ports. Reported to work with the proprietary Matrox X driver.
<item>Matrox Millennium 450GX AGP. Uses external adapter to provide
Composite and SVideo ports. TV-out implementation does <em>NOT</em> support XVideo.
<item>Matrox Millennium 550GX AGP. Uses external adapter to provide
Composite and S-Video ports. TV-out implementation does <em>NOT</em> support XVideo.
</itemize>

<sect3>NVIDIA
<p>Some NVIDIA cards with TV-out can be run using the standard nv driver in 
XFree86, combined with the userspace application <bf>nvtv</bf> to control the TV-out 
port. See <url url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/"
name="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/"> for details.  Recent
versions of the NVIDIA driver have better support for overscan and other
features useful with TV-Out, so the <bf>nvtv</bf> application may not be
required.

Some NVIDIA cards can be run with a proprietary NVIDIA X driver made
available by NVIDIA. See <url url="http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=linux"
name="http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=linux"> for more information.

Specific cards:
<itemize>
<item>GeForce4 MX440-SE AGP. Has Composite and SVideo ports. Works using the
NVIDIA X driver.
<item>GeForce2 GTS 64 MB DDR 4x AGP. Has SVideo port. Works using the NVIDIA X 
driver. Reportedly works using the nv driver plus nvtv.
<item>GeForce4 MX420 PCI (BFG Asylum). Has SVideo port.
</itemize>

<sect3>Savage
<p>The standard savage X driver supports TV out on some Savage cards. 
Unfortunately, XVideo support for the Savage 2000 card (a very common and 
inexpensive Savage card with TV out) is broken. See 
<url url="http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html"
name="http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html"> for details.

Specific cards:
<itemize>
<item>Savage 2000 AGP. Has Composite and SVideo ports. Does not support XVideo.
<item>S3 Savage IX 8MB AGP. Has SVideo output. Reported to work.
</itemize>

<sect3>Hauppauge PVR-350
<p>MythTV supports the TV-out and MPEG-2 decoder functions in the IvyTV driver.

<sect3>Other Options
<p>Some devices with on-board TV-out capability, such as XBoxes converted to 
Linux and some laptops, can be used as MythTV frontends to display on a 
television screen. Please consult the mythtv-users mailing list for messages 
that report the details of these special arrangements.

<sect2>External Adapters
<p>External adapters convert standard VGA output to a form suitable for 
display on a television. The output format varies by region, since 
different countries have different TV standards. People on the mythtv-users 
list have mentioned these adapters:

<itemize>
<item>AITech Web Cable Plus, powered by external transformer or takes power
from PS/2 keyboard connector, support resolutions up to 1024x768, outputs
composite and SVideo, provides position adjustment.
<item>Averkey lite, powered by a USB port, has Composite, SVideo, YPbPr
outputs; pan, brightness, overscan/underscan controls; supports up to
1024x768 outputs; and supports PAL and NTSC.
<item>ADS TV Elite XGA
<item>AverKey iMicro (comments are generally favorable)
<item>AITech Web Cable (comments are generally unfavorable, different than
the "Plus" version above)
<item>TVIEW Gold (mentioned once, favorably)
</itemize>

<sect1>Software
<p>There are a few ways of installing programs on Linux systems; you can
either use a pre-compiled package, or install from a tarball after
satisfying any prerequisites.

<bf>BIG FAT WARNING</bf>:  This HOWTO assumes that you have <em>not</em>
installed MythTV from a package.  All example command lines and file
locations are based on the MythTV tarball defaults.  Some packagers have
modified the filenames, binaries and file locations to match what is
commonly found in that distribution.  Any issues with MythTV installed via a
pre-compiled package <bf>MUST</bf> be raised with the packager.

Installation instructions can be found on those pages as well. All of the
prerequisites for MythTV are available as Debian packages, most of them from
the official Debian archive.

If you have followed the instructions on the above page you should have added
<tscreen><verb>
deb-src http://dijkstra.csh.rit.edu/~mdz/debian unstable mythtv
</verb></tscreen>

to your <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> file.  Running <bf>apt-get update</bf> and then
executing <bf>apt-get build-dep mythtv</bf> should install all the
pre-requisites required to compile MythTV.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="warning.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="warning.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  Due to the requirement for Qt 3.1, there are no packages for
Debian woody/stable.
</caption></figure>

<p>The Debian packages are configured such that MythTV programs should be
run as the <tt>mythtv</tt> user, which is automatically created during
installation.  This user has access to write new recordings to disk in the
default directory, read and write the database, access the audio and video
devices, and everything else that MythTV needs to do.

<p>See <tt>/usr/share/doc/<it>packagename</it>/README.Debian</tt> for more
information, including copies of the MythTV documentation.  The
<tt>mythtv-doc</tt> package contains a copy of this HOWTO in
<tt>/usr/share/doc/mythtv-doc</tt>.

<sect2>Manual installation
<p>You may use the graphical tools that come with your distribution, or you
can use command-line utilities.  Either system will get the job done, and it
all depends on your comfort level with Linux.

In order to compile MythTV, we need to make sure that the software it needs
is installed.  As of 2003-03-15, this list includes <bf>mysql</bf>,
<bf>gcc</bf>, <bf>freetype2-devel</bf>, <bf>XFree86-devel</bf>,
<bf>qt-devel</bf> and <bf>lame</bf>.  If you're going to use a remote
control with MythTV, you're going to need the <bf>cdialog</bf> package in
order to compile <bf>lircd</bf> if your distribution doesn't have a
pre-packaged <bf>lirc</bf>.  If you are using <bf>XMLTV</bf> as a grabber,
you will need <bf>perl</bf>.

<code>
NOTE:  Qt v3.1 or higher is required.

NOTE:  If you are going to be using RPMs to install various
components, you should be aware that not all packages include the necessary
headers for compiling packages.  If you're having trouble compiling, ensure
that you've installed the -devel version of a prerequisite.

NOTE:  Other than where noted, Mandrake 9.1 and 10.0 users may follow the
Mandrake 9.0 instructions.
</code>

<sect2>Graphical installation tools <label id="graphicinstalltools_">
<sect3>Mandrake 9.0
<p>On systems running KDE, a tool which will allow you to see what packages
are available and if they're installed on your system can be accessed by
clicking K->Configuration->Packaging->KPackage

While the graphical tools are nice, the command line tool is actually easier
to use.  It's strongly recommended that you use the command line tool.

There are many inter-related modules, so make sure that you've got the
main package for each one, and not a sub package for an unrelated item.  For
example, there are many modules that have "perl" in them; some are a part of
the apache web server, others are a part of the perl distribution.  In each
case, we're looking to make sure that the primary module is getting
installed.

Click the magnifying glass or press <bf>CTRL-F</bf> and enter "perl" as your
search term.  You should find it under the "Perl" folder.  You need at least
the perl 5.80 base package installed.  If not, click on the "Mark" button.

If you are going to be installing MySQL on this system, search for mysql -
it should be under "Databases".  Make sure that mysql and mysql-clients are
installed.  If not, click on "Mark".

Search for gcc.  You're going to need gcc and gcc-c++ installed.

Search for freetype2.  Make sure that you've got freetype2 and
freetype2-devel installed.

Search for XFree86-devel.

Finally, check for qt.  You'll need libqt3-devel (under folder "KDE and
Qt") and libqt3 ("Libraries").

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="warning.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="warning.png">
<caption>NOTE for Mandrake 9.1 users:  Mandrake 9.1 has removed the MySQL modules
from the default installation.  Ensure that you install libqt3-mysql.
</caption>
</figure>

Make sure that cdialog is installed if you want to use MythTV with a remote
control if you need to compile <bf>lirc</bf> from source.

alsa-utils is needed for setting the volume.  MythTV now has native volume
support, but you may have a special configuration that necessitates an
external program to adjust your volume settings.  If this is the case, then
you can disable native volume support.

If you marked anything to install, click on Install Marked.  Click "Yes" or
OK if you get a message about satisfying dependencies.

<sect2>Command-line installation <label id="CLIinstalltools_">
<p> This section details the various methods for installing prerequisites
from the command line.

<sect3>Mandrake
<p><bf>urpmi</bf> is the simplest tool for installation of packages from the
command line, but properly configuring it can be difficult.  The
following website <url url="http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php"
name="http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php"> will allow you to choose
a mirror site and then present the command-line configuration text for that
mirror.  You will most likely need to add a "Contrib" mirror to your setup. 
If you add a site from the "Penguin Liberation Front", you will be able to
load the <tt>lame</tt> library without compiling from source.

<sect4>Mandrake 9.0
<p>The simplest tool for installing packages from the command line is
<bf>urpmi</bf>.

Open a shell, and execute the following, all on the same line. You may get
asked a number of questions regarding dependencies.  It's best to answer
"YES".
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# urpmi mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel cdialog alsa-utils
# urpmi XFree86-devel perl
# urpmi libqt3-devel
</verb></tscreen>

<code>
NOTE for Mandrake 9.1 users: execute the following command.

# urpmi libqt3-mysql
</code>
However, you might get this when you execute the command above:
<tscreen><verb>
[root@pvr root]# urpmi mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel libqt3-devel alsa-utils XFree86-devel perl
everything already installed
</verb></tscreen>

In that case, you're ready to move to the next <ref id="Setting_up_paths"
name="section">.  Once you have completed installing the pre-requisites,
exit out of the shell and start a new one to ensure that any environment
variables setup by the installation have a chance to take effect.
<sect3>Gentoo. 
<p>If Qt has not been installed on your system: Edit
<tt>/etc/make.conf</tt> and locate the "USE" variable. If the line is
commented out, remove the comment. The line should have at least:
<tscreen><verb>
USE="mysql alsa"
</verb></tscreen>
Next you need to build Qt. If you don't plan on using the ebuilds as 
described in the Gentoo section then you also need to install lame.
<tscreen><verb>
# emerge lame mysql qt
</verb></tscreen>
<p>If you have already installed Qt: you will need to rebuild because the
default installation doesn't include MySQL support, a requirement for MythTV.  
To enable SQL support, add "mysql" to your USE variable in 
<tt>/etc/make.conf</tt> and rebuild Qt by running
<tscreen><verb>
# emerge qt
</verb></tscreen>

All the necessary files will be downloaded and built. Even on a fast machine
this may take a lot of time if you need to do a full Qt build.

<sect>System Configuration Requirements for Compiling MythTV. <label
id="Setting_up_paths">
<p>Before you compile MythTV from the current source tarball or from CVS, you 
may need to modify your system configuration in a few ways.

In general, if you install MythTV from pre-packaged binaries for your Linux
distribution/version, you don't need to be too concerned about the issues in
this section of the HOWTO - the install script for the packages should take
care of them. However, this section is still recommended reading which may
help if the packager skipped a step in their packaging.

<sect1>Software requirements for compiling MythTV
<sect2>General requirements
<p>MythTV is written in C++ and requires a fairly complete, but standard, 
compilation environment, including a recent g++ compiler, <tt>make</tt>, and 
appropriate headers files for shared libraries. Any standard Linux 
distribution should be able to install a suitable compilation environment 
from its packaging system. Section 3.2 of this HOWTO provides some details 
of how to install the required environment for many distributions.

Subsequent sections of this chapter address the few oddities that you may 
have to adjust by hand before you compile MythTV.

The reference compilation system for MythTV is Debian.

<sect1>Shared-Library Requirements for MythTV 
<sect2>Modifying /etc/ld.so.conf <label id="modifying_ld.so.conf">
<p>The runtime manager for shared libraries, <bf>/lib/ld.so</bf>, gets
information about the locations and contents of shared libraries from
<tt>/etc/ld.so.cache</tt>, a file created by <bf>ldconfig</bf> from
information in <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf</tt>.  Because MythTV installs some
shared libraries in <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt>, that directory needs to be
added to the list of directories for <bf>ld.so</bf> to search when doing
runtime linking of programs, if it is not already there.
You do this, as root, by editing <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf</tt>, then
running <bf>ldconfig</bf>. There are many ways to do this; one that
works is to enter this series of commands:

<tscreen><verb>
$ su -
# echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf
# /sbin/ldconfig
# exit
$
</verb></tscreen>
<sect1>Environment variable Requirements for MythTV
<sect2>General requirements
<sect3>QT libraries and binaries
<p>The compiler needs to be able to locate QT binaries and libraries in
order to compile MythTV. QTDIR needs to be set and the directory holding the
QT binaries needs to be added to your PATH.  Your distribution may already
be making these changes as a part of the installation of the software
prerequisites detailed earlier.

One way to do this is as follows: <label id="Checking_that_it_worked">

Open a shell and execute the following:
<tscreen><verb>
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games:/usr/lib/qt3/bin:/home/mythtv/bin:/usr/lib/qt3/bin
$ echo $QTDIR
/usr/lib/qt3
$ which qmake
/usr/lib/qt3/bin/qmake
</verb></tscreen>

For Mandrake, you should see a value like <tt>/usr/lib/qt3</tt> for
<tt>QTDIR</tt> and <tt>/usr/lib/qt3/bin</tt> should be in $PATH.

For Gentoo, you should see a value like <tt>/usr/qt/3</tt> for <tt>QTDIR</tt> 
and <tt>/usr/qt/3/bin</tt> should be in $PATH.

If you don't, do not proceed past this step until you have resolved this
error. You may need to manually specify the QTDIR and PATH at the shell
prompt before compiling.

Also, check that there has been a link created in
<tt>/usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs</tt> (<tt>/usr/share/qt3/mkspecs</tt> for Debian)
called <tt>default</tt>. If not, you'll get errors during the compile. See
the Troubleshooting Section for more information.
<sect2>Distribution-Specific Notes
<sect3>Mandrake
<p>The following instructions work for Mandrake 9.0 and 9.1 using
<bf>bash</bf> as the shell, and may be applicable for a distribution which
uses <tt>/etc/profile.d</tt>.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  Mandrake 10 installs a <tt>/etc/profile.d/qtdir3.sh</tt>
file, but it doesn't include the addition of the PATH variable.  If you're
running Mandrake 10, don't create a <tt>mythtv.sh</tt> file as detailed
below; edit the <tt>qtdir3.sh</tt> file and add the PATH statement within
the if / fi block.
</caption>
</figure>
As root, create the following file in <tt>/etc/profile.d</tt> The example
filename is "mythtv.sh". Use what you feel is appropriate.

Open a shell, and switch to superuser mode. 

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="warning.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="warning.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>: ^D means press CTRL and d at the same time.
</caption>
</figure>
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# cd /etc/profile.d
cat > mythtv.sh
export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/qt3/bin
^D

# chmod a+x mythtv.sh
# exit
$ exit
</verb></tscreen>
The last two commands are to exit out of the shell. This way, when you next 
open a shell your new commands
will take effect.
<sect3>Red Hat Linux 9
<p>Red Hat Linux 9 use a default locale with UTF-8 encoding.
Date::Manip, a perl module used by XMLTV, is not UTF-8 safe. As a result,
whenever you run setup or mythfilldatabase you will get a lot of UTF-8
warnings. There is an <url url="http://membled.com/work/patches/DateManip/"
name="http://membled.com/work/patches/DateManip/"> updated version of
Date::Manip at the XMLTV site fixing this and other XMLTV related
bugs.

<sect3>Debian
<p>Debian source packages are available from the same place as the
binary packages.  These can be used to build customized packages, and
to automatically satisfy MythTV's build-time dependencies.

<sect2>Device Permissions <label id="devperms">
<p>MythTV will need access to the video4linux devices on your system.  By
default, your distribution may restrict access to these devices to the

session you will need to make some adjustments.

<bf>NOTE</bf>: The following instructions are accurate for Mandrake.

Check for a file called <tt>/etc/security/console.perms</tt>.  Open the file
in your favorite text editor and look for a line that has:
<tscreen><verb>

<sect>Downloading and compiling.
<p>Get MythTV from the <url url="http://www.mythtv.org" name="mythtv.org">
web site.  There are two installation methods you may choose from.  The
first is to download the latest release in tarball format and compile.  The
tarball release of MythTV should work on a wide variety of systems and
should be the preferred method for new users.  If you wish to use the CVS
version of MythTV you may obtain it from CVS this way:
<label id="cvs">
<tscreen><verb>
$ mkdir mythtv
$ cd mythtv
$ cvs -d :pserver:mythtv@cvs.mythtv.org:/var/lib/mythcvs login
Logging in to :pserver:mythtv@cvs.mythtv.org:/var/lib/mythcvs
CVS password: mythtv
$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:mythtv@cvs.mythtv.org:/var/lib/mythcvs checkout mythtv
</verb></tscreen>

<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  You may get an error about cvs not finding a
<tt>.cvspass</tt> file the very first time you run it.  This is normal.
</caption>
</figure>
The other MythTV modules may be downloaded from CVS the same way; replace
"mythtv" with "mythweather", "mythgallery", "mythmusic", etc.

If you wish to stay up-to-date with CVS, you may replace "checkout mythtv"
with <tt>update mythtv</tt> after you've done your initial download.

If you are in North America you will use the DataDirect
grabber which is built-in to MythTV.  You <em>do not</em> need to install
XMLTV, but you need <bf>wget</bf> version 1.9.1 or higher.

Get XMLTV from <url url="http://xmltv.sourceforge.net"

<sect1>Notes on compiling for different processors
<label id="cpuspecificoptimizations">
<P>By default, MythTV is compiled for a Pentium Pro or i686 processor. This
generates good code for most CPUs, but does not take advantage of MMX or
SSE, and does not work with recent processors that are compatible with older
Intel processors, such as the Via or IDT low power processors. So you may
wish to, or need to, change this before compiling. The flags in bold are
required if you have that CPU.

If you have a system with an AMD processor change the following in the
<tt>settings.pro</tt> file. Replace <verb>-march=pentiumpro</verb> before
you compile with one of:
<itemize>
<item><bf>-march=k6</bf>        for the AMD K6 with MMX (i586 compatible)
<item><bf>-march=k6-2</bf>      for the AMD K6 CPU with MMX and 3dNOW! (i586 compatible)
<item>-march=athlon             for the AMD Athlon CPU with MMX, 3dNOW!, enhanced 3dNOW! and some of SSE. (pentium2 compatible)
<item>-march=pentiumpro -mmmx   for the AMD Athlon XP CPU with MMX, 3dNOW!, enhanced 3dNOW! and SSE. (pentium3 compatible)
<item>-march=k8                 for the AMD K8 core based CPUs with x86-64 instruction set support
                                with MMX, 3dNOW!, enhanced 3dNOW!, SSE and SSE2. (pentium4 compatible)
</itemize>

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption>
<bf>NOTE</bf>:  If you wish to compile with the <tt>-march=k8</tt> flag you
must use gcc v3.4 or higher.
</caption>
</figure>

If you have a Via processor change the following in the
<tt>settings.pro</tt> file. Replace <verb>-march=pentiumpro</verb> before
you compile with one of:
<itemize>
<item><bf>-march=c3</bf>        for the Via C3 CPU with MMX and 3dNOW! instruction set support. (pentium-mmx compatible)
<item><bf>-march=c3-2</bf>      for the Via C3-2 CPU with MMX and SSE instruction set support. (pentium2 compatible)
</itemize>

If you have an IDT Winchip processor change the following in the
<tt>settings.pro</tt> file. Replace <verb>-march=pentiumpro</verb> before
you compile with one of:
<itemize>
<item><bf>-march=winchip-c6</bf>  for the IDT Winchip C6 CPU with MMX (i486 compatible)
<item><bf>-march=winchip2</bf>    for the IDT Winchip2 CPU, with MMX and 3dNOW! (i486 compatible)
</itemize>

Finally, if you have an Intel processor other than the Pentium Pro you may
wish to specify your particular model. Replace
<verb>-march=pentiumpro</verb> before you compile with one of:
<itemize>
<item><bf>-march=i586</bf>        for the Intel Pentium CPU without MMX
<item><bf>-march=pentium-mmx</bf> for the Intel PentiumMMX CPU based on Pentium core with MMX
<item>-march=pentium2    for the Intel Pentium2 CPU based on Pentium Pro core with MMX
<item>-march=pentium3    for the Intel Pentium3 CPU based on Pentium Pro core with MMX and SSE
<item>-march=pentium-m   for the Low power version of Intel Pentium3 CPU with MMX, SSE and SSE2
<item>-march=pentium4    for the Intel Pentium4 CPU with MMX, SSE and SSE2
<item>-march=prescott    for the Intel Pentium4 CPU with MMX, SSE, SSE2 and SSE3
<item>-march=nocona      for the Intel Pentium4 CPU with 64-bit extensions, MMX, SSE, SSE2 and SSE3
</itemize>

<bf>NOTE</bf>: If your version of gcc does not support your processor,
choose the most recent processor supported by your compiler and add any
extra features, for instance the <tt>-march=winchip-c6</tt> would become
<tt>-march=i486 -mmmx</tt> for the IDT Winchip C6 CPU. It's also recommended
that when compiling for the for the Athlon XP you leave the default of
<verb>-march=pentiumpro</verb> because gcc doesn't properly optimize for the
Athlon XP.

<sect1>Configuring the Zap2It.com DataDirect service <label id="ConfigureDD">
<sect2>Introduction
<p>Zap2It DataDirect is a service provided by Zap2It, a subsidiary of
Tribune Media Services.  TMS is one of the primary providers for program
listing data in the United States and Canada.  There are a number of
advantages to using DataDirect rather than the standard XMLTV
<tt>tv_grab_na</tt> grabber.

<itemize>
<item>The <tt>tv_grab_na</tt> grabber is no longer supported and will not be
fixed when problems occur.
<item>It's much faster, because the grabber isn't downloading hundreds of
HTML pages and trying to parse the program data out of the HTML.
<item>It contains more program information.
<item>It's easier on the Zap2It servers, since they're not generating
hundreds of custom HTML pages when you scrape their listings.
<item>The service is available free of charge by periodically filling in
surveys similar to the one presented during registration, and the data
provider has no intention of charging for it in the future.
</itemize>

If you wish to use Zap2It DataDirect, you'll need to establish a user
account.  Go to <url url="http://labs.zap2it.com"
name="http://labs.zap2it.com"> and click on the "New User? Sign Up" link. 
Read the license terms, and if you agree with them click "Accept".  The next
screen is the subscription registration.  In the "Certificate Code" field,
enter <bf>ZIYN-DQZO-SBUT</bf>.

Fill in the survey, then proceed to the lineup choices and configure your
account for your particular location and the channels that you have.  This
configuration will be imported into MythTV when you first run the
<bf>setup</bf> program.

See the section called <ref id="MigratingtoDD" name="Migrating from XMLTV
to DataDirect"> for instructions on moving to to DataDirect if you are
currently using XMLTV.  If you are starting from a fresh installation, the
simplest thing is to immediately start using DataDirect.

<label id="manually_building_mythtv">
<sect1>Manually building MythTV
<p>Unpack MythTV
<tscreen><verb>
$ tar -xjf mythtv-0.17.tar.bz2
$ cd mythtv-0.17
$ ./configure
</verb></tscreen>

On a single cpu machine, you would type the following to compile MythTV:
<tscreen><verb>
$ qmake mythtv.pro
$ make
</verb></tscreen>

If you want to build MythTV on a multi-CPU machine (or with
<bf>distcc</bf>), specify "-j numjobs".  In the following example, we will
have two concurrent jobs executing.  Do not set the number of jobs too high,
or your compile will actually take longer to complete than it would if you
did a "normal" build.
<tscreen><verb>
$ qmake mythtv.pro
$ make qmake
$ make -j 2
</verb></tscreen>

If you are using <bf>distcc</bf>, and you had two other host machines (red, blue)
participating, you would do something like:
<tscreen><verb>
$ export DISTCC_HOSTS='localhost red blue'
$ qmake mythtv.pro
$ make qmake
$ make -j 6 CXX=distcc
</verb></tscreen>

The actual speed-up, if any, is dependant on a number of factors, such as
number of CPUs / hosts, etc.  The <bf>distcc</bf> documentation recommends
using a <tt>-j</tt> value of twice the number of CPUs available to keep all
of them busy.

Some timing information.  The following should only be used for
illustration; your actual results may vary.  The test involves a complete
<tt>make distclean</tt> to the final binary.
<itemize>
<item>P4 3.2Ghz HT: "standard" make: 12m 49s
<item>P4 3.2Ghz HT: make -j 2: 11m 24s 
</itemize>

In the above example, we see that with a single CPU, a multi-stage
<bf>make</bf> does not significantly decrease compile time.

Once the compile is done, switch to superuser:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# make install
# exit
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Enabling real-time scheduling of the display thread.

<p>MythTV supports real-time scheduling of the video output thread if it is
installed SUID root.

This is an optional, but recommended step, if you understand the potential
negative impact.  As a positive, It can make the video display more
smoothly, especially if you are decoding HDTV.

<bf>NOTE</bf>:  Making this change will affect your ability to run
<bf>mythfrontend</bf> within <bf>gdb</bf> for debugging purposes.  If you

<sect2>Frontend-only configuration <label id="frontend-only">
<p>Since MythTV uses a client/server architecture, multiple frontend
computers can simultaneously access content on a Myth system.  Live TV,
watching and scheduling recordings, etc. are all possible from multiple
frontends.

To get a better picture of what is needed to run a frontend, note the
following:
<list>
<item>You do NOT need the MySQL server installed on your remote frontend
<item>You do NOT need XMLTV installed on your remote frontend
<item>You do NOT need to run the MythTV setup program on
your frontend machine
</list>

Other than the exclusion of the MySQL server and XMLTV, the MythTV
compilation procedure is the same as when you're setting up both a backend
and a frontend.  However, you <em>will</em> need to install the database
access libraries.

Once MythTV is compiled and installed:
<list>
<item>
Run the MythTV setup program on your Master backend. Under the "General"
menu, change the IP address of the current machine (by default, "127.0.0.1")
to the real external IP address - 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address and no
external machine can access it. Change the Master Server IP setting to the
same IP address as well.
<item>
Run the mythfrontend program on your frontend machine,
and a "Database Configuration" screen should appear.
Set the "Host name" field to point to your Master backend's IP address.

</verb></tscreen>

<sect>Configuring Sound.
<p>If your video doesn't appear to be in-sync with your audio, it could be
because you are listening to the real-time audio from your video card rather
than after it's been processed and synchronized to the video by MythTV. 
Because MythTV is a personal video recorder, "Live TV" isn't really live -
to let you pause live TV, MythTV is actually encoding the video, saving to
disk, and then playing it back.  This procedure puts your MythTV "live" TV
about 2 seconds behind real-time, so it's important that you're not
listening to the live audio.  However, if you're having an issue where the
audio and video aren't synchronized by small but varying amount, it's most
likely because the sound driver that you're using doesn't have the
DSP_CAP_REALTIME capability.  This was the case with ALSA (0.5), but not
with newer versions (0.9).  See the <ref id="Troubleshooting_Audio"
name="Troubleshooting Audio"> section for more information if you're having
issues with sound.  Also, ensure that no other programs are grabbing the
audio output, like <bf>arts</bf> or <bf>esd</bf>.

What you need to do is to mute the "line-in" of your sound card and also
set it as the recording source.

There are two ways to do this.  Graphically, and from the command line.

<sect1>Graphically setting up the mixer
<sect2>Mandrake 9.0 and Red Hat Linux/Fedora Core
<p>Open Kmix by clicking K->Multimedia->Sound->Kmix for Mandrake, or
<verb>RedHat Menu>Sound & Video>Volume Control</verb> on Red Hat/Fedora.

Click on Settings->Configure  Make sure that "Tick Marks" and "Show
labels" have "X"'s in them.  This will make it easier to find the correct
audio source.  Click OK.

On the mixer page, look for Line-In on your sound card.  You should see
two LED's - a green one at the top, and a red one at the bottom.  The green
one at the top is for muting; you want to make sure that the green LED is a
dark green, meaning that it's "off".  You also want to click on the red LED
so that it turns bright red, indicating that it's "ON"; this insures that
the Line-in is used as the source.  Click OK, and make sure that you save
the settings so that this is your default.

<sect3>Using OSS drivers.
<p>Red Hat Linux and Fedora Core 1 ship with OSS sound drivers rather than the ALSA
drivers recommended by the MythTV team. The OSS drivers do work for many
people, and for many cards. We recommend that you give OSS a try since it is
already included in the vendor distribution. However, some people report problems (sync
and jitter) with OSS, and in addition it does not support full duplex on
some cards.  Full duplex is required if you want to record and play sound
using just one sound card. ALSA has good full duplex support, and also has
drivers for some built-in (motherboard) sound cards that OSS does not.
Installing ALSA is less painful than you might think, so if OSS does not
work for you, installing ALSA is not too difficult. For those of you who do
not wish to install ALSA you must do this:

To configure sound to work with MythTV, select <verb>RedHat Menu>Sound &
Video>Volume Control</verb> to open up a mixer. Make sure your global volume
(on the far left) is up. Also make sure that the "line in" section has
"mute" and "record" checked and that the gain is turned up. You may have to
experiment with volume/gain levels to get the best sound.  

<sect3>Using ALSA.
<p>If you'd like to use ALSA, you'll need to correctly setup your
<tt>asoundrc</tt> file. Configuring this file is beyond the scope of this
HOWTO.  Once ALSA is working correctly, change the output sound device in
mythfrontend->setup->Audio from <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> to <tt>ALSA:default</tt>.
This field may be edited to suit your ALSA requirements.

<sect1>Setting the mixer from the command line
<p>If you have installed the alsa-utils package, then the <bf>amixer</bf>
program can be used to setup the mixer.  The "Master" volume setting is only
required on a frontend machine to ensure that the sound channels are unmuted
and configured for outputting sound.  The "Line" and "Capture" controls are
required for your sound card to actually capture audio from the external
Line-in.  Not all sound cards have a "Capture" control, but if yours does
and you don't set it then MythTV will not capture audio.

<code>
Note the spelling in the following commands.
</code>
<tscreen><verb>
$ amixer set Master,0 100%,100% unmute
$ amixer set PCM,0 100%,100% unmute
$ amixer set Line,0 75%,75% mute captur
$ amixer set Capture,0 100%,100% captur
$ su
# alsactl store
# exit
$ 
</verb></tscreen>

If you have multiple sound cards, then use the <tt>-c</tt> parameter to
specify which card to adjust.  Note that the first card will be "0", the
second will be "1", etc.

That takes care of setting the volume correctly, and the ALSA startup script
will restore the volume after a reboot.  If you find that your sound is
distorted, it's possible that the levels in the above examples are too high
for your particular hardware combination.  Try reducing the percentages by
5-10% and checking again.  Once you're satisfied, re-run the <tt>alsactl
store</tt> command.

You may also use the <bf>alsamixer</bf> program to set the volume. If you
are using an ALSA version after 1.0.6, use <bf>alsamixer -V all</bf> . First,
start <bf>alsamixer</bf> from the command line.  You should start out on the
"Master" volume control slider.  Use the up and down cursor to set the
master volume to around 75%.  Next, use the left and right cursor keys to
move around on the screen until you find the "Line" slider.  Press SPACE to
set it as the capture source, set the level to around 50-75% and press "M"
to mute it.  You can now press ESC to exit out of the <bf>alsamixer</bf>
program.  You can also have MythTV manage all volume and mute settings, but
this will only affect the "Master" or PCM volume, not the capture volume.  See
the mythfrontend setup page for options.
 
<sect>Setting up a remote control.
<p>MythTV does not have native remote control receiver and decoder software
built-in.  Instead, remote control functions are implemented by cooperating
with <bf>lirc</bf>, the Linux Infrared Remote Control program.  <bf>lirc</bf>
handles the IR hardware and passes keystrokes to MythTV, which then acts as
if the user had pressed the keys on the keyboard.  The file
<tt>keys.txt</tt> describes the keys used to control MythTV.

Some IR devices require a kernel recompile, and some don't. However, all at
least require having the kernel source available as a resource for the lirc
build process. 

<sect1>Gentoo
<p>To install lirc on Gentoo, all you need to do is:
<tscreen><verb>
# emerge lirc
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Mandrake 9.0
<p>lircd has two prerequisites:  <bf>dialog</bf>, available in Mandrake
through the "cdialog" RPM, and the kernel source.  Mandrake 9.0 is using the
2.4.19 kernel, so either install the kernel sources from the installation CD
or go to <url url="http://www.kernel.org" name="http://www.kernel.org"> and
download the full 2.4.19 tar file from <url
url="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/"
name="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/">.

<sect2>Obtaining the kernel
<p>Install using urpmi.
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# urpmi kernel-source
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Red Hat Linux/Fedora Core
<p>You should already have the source from the "Kernel Development" package
you installed in section 3.2. Ensure that a symlink has been created:
<tscreen><verb>
$ cd /usr/src
$ su
# ln -s linux-2.4 /usr/src/linux
# exit
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Obtaining and compiling lirc
<p>You're going to need to download and compile <bf>lircd</bf>.  Go to <url
url="http://www.lirc.org" name="http://www.lirc.org"> and download lirc; as
of 2002-11-07, the version available is 0.6.6.  Grab the remotes.tgz file as
well. 
<tscreen><verb>
$ tar -xjf lirc-0.6.6.tar.bz2
$ cd lirc-0.6.6
$ ./setup.sh
</verb></tscreen>
You're going to need to know what sort of receiver you have and where it's
connected.  In the case of the Pinnacle Studio TV card, with the IR receiver
connected to COM1 (/dev/ttys0), once the configuration menu comes up,
perform the configuration by going to Driver Configuration->Other Serial
Port Devices->Pinnacle Systems Receiver->OK and on the next page select
COM1->OK.

Each remote is different; some remote receivers connect directly to your
capture card and not to a serial port, so make sure that you've got the
correct one.

You then click "Save Configuration and run configure" to continue.

Make sure you read the last text generated by the configure step. It will
tell you if you require a kernel recompile, and what the name of your kernel
module will be (if necessary). For instance a home-built receiver may
require a kernel recompile, so you would be notified that you will have to
load the lirc_serial module. If you did not get any such messages skip the
kernel recompile steps below and go directly to making and installing the
lirc driver.

Once the configuration step is complete:
<tscreen><verb>
$ make
$ su
# make install
# chmod 666 /dev/lircd
</verb></tscreen>

At this point, if you're using a serial receiver, check that there's a
<tt>lirc</tt> device in <tt>/dev</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
$ ls -l /dev/li*
lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            5 Jan 27 09:00 /dev/lirc -> ttyS0
srw-rw-rw-    1 root     root            0 Jan 27 15:01 /dev/lircd=
prw-r--r--    1 root     root            0 Jan 27 09:00 /dev/lircm|
</verb></tscreen>

As you can see, there's a link from /dev/lirc to ttyS0, a.k.a. "COM1", which is
appropriate for the Pinnacle Systems PCTV Pro.  However, you may notice
something like this:
<tscreen><verb>
crw-------    1 root     root      61,   0 Dec 31  1969 lirc
</verb></tscreen>
Some IR receivers (including some homebrew units) use a character device as
their data interface as opposed to a link to a serial port.  If the <tt>make
install</tt> step has created a character device for you, don't replace it
with a link to a COM port.

So, if the link or character device was not created (but should have been),
ensure that you ran the <tt>make install</tt> step as root.  If it still
doesn't work, then there are three options.  The first option is to re-read
the <bf>lirc</bf> documentation to determine whether your IR receiver is a
character device or should be a link to a serial port and to create the
link/character device manually.  In this example, the IR device is connected
to ttyS0.  If it were connected to "COM2", then use ttyS1, etc.
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# cd /dev
# ln -sf ttyS0 lirc
# exit
$
</verb></tscreen>

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  The above example assumes that your receiver uses the
standard serial driver.  Some receivers do not, including receivers that
plug into a TV capture card.  Check the lirc documentation, but it may be
necessary to replace the link created above with a character pipe:
</caption>
</figure>
<tscreen><verb>
# mknod /dev/lirc c 61 0
</verb></tscreen>

See the lirc documentation for additional information.  The lirc
installation <em>should</em> create this for you, so manually creating it
indicates that your lirc installation may have other issues.

The second option is to post your issue to the <em>lirc</em> list, not the
mythtv-users list.  The lirc programmers will be the ones that can assist
you best.

The third option is to dispense with lirc altogether by purchasing an IR
keyboard (various options exist, although Chicony appears to work for some
people) and a learning remote control.  The IR keyboard receiver plugs into
the PS/2 keyboard port on your PC and you would train your learning remote
to emulate the various keystrokes from <tt>keys.txt</tt> of your IR
keyboard.  Using this method removes lirc entirely from the picture - your
remote will be sending keypresses that your PC "sees" on the keyboard port.

<sect2>Recompiling your kernel on Red Hat Linux/Fedora Core
<p>Don't Panic! Red Hat makes a kernel recompile very easy. They provide  
configuration files that make it so you can recompile your kernel with  
Red Hat defaults. And as a side benefit, your kernel will be compiled  
specifically for your architecture. For a more detailed description (or  
if you run into trouble) of how to do this go to  
<url url="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/custom-guide/ch-custom-kernel.html"

<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>: Suitable Red Hat kernels for MythTV (i2c update, v4l2 API,
CONFIG_SERIAL modularized) are available from ATrpms: <url

suitable kernel modules for ALSA, lirc, bttv, ivtv, saa7134 etc. there. See

For the impatient:
Make sure you have an emergency floppy boot disk available!
<tscreen><verb>
$ cd /usr/src/linux
$ su
# make mrproper
# cd configs
# ls
</verb></tscreen>

at this point you must look at the file names and determine which  
config file is right for you. For instance if you have an Athlon XP you  
should choose "kernel-2.4.18-athlon.config" but if you have a dual  
processor P4 you might choose "kernel-2.4.18-i686-smp.config"
<tscreen><verb>
# cp yourconfig.config ../.config
# cd ../
# make xconfig
</verb></tscreen>

At this point you will get a graphical configuration utility. All that  
you must do to make lirc work is go to the "character devices" section  
and change "Standard/generic (8250/16550 and compatible UARTs) serial  
support" from "y" to "m". Now if you want you can have a look around.  
For instance, you might wish to turn off ham radio support, or perhaps  
turn off PCMCIA support if you are not on a laptop. But be careful!  
Only change things you know you can change. If you are not sure, just  
stick to the one required change. Click "save and exit".
Next:
<tscreen><verb>
# make dep
# make clean
# make bzImage modules
# make modules_install
# make install

if you are using <bf>grub</bf>, that should be it, reboot and select your custom  
kernel upon boot. If you are using <bf>lilo</bf>, change your lilo configuration  
according to  
<url url="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/custom-guide/

<p>If the lirc configure program / compile did not mention anything about a
kernel module, then you are finished. If it did mention a kernel module, you
must edit the <tt>/etc/modules.conf</tt> file. Add this line as the first
thing in the file.  It must come first, or it may not work.
<tscreen><verb>
alias char-major-61 XXX
</verb></tscreen>

replace XXX with the name which you determined earlier, which in this
example was "lirc_serial"
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# modprobe lirc_serial
# /sbin/ldconfig
</verb></tscreen>

Next, we're going to manually start lircd the first time.  Mandrake 9.1
users, type: <tt># /etc/rc.d/init.d/lircd start</tt> instead of:
<tscreen><verb>
# /usr/local/sbin/lircd
</verb></tscreen>

If this fails, complaining of a missing <tt>lircd.conf</tt> file, then you
must find or make one. First look for a pre-made configuration file at <url
url="http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/"
name="http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/">.  Mandrake 9.1 users, look in
<tt>/usr/share/lirc-remotes</tt>. If you find one your remotes either on the
website or in <tt>/usr/share</tt>, download or copy the file, name it
<tt>lircd.conf</tt> and put it in your <tt>/etc</tt> directory. If you
couldn't find your remote, you must make your own <tt>lircd.conf</tt> file.

To make your own <tt>lircd.conf</tt> file
<tscreen><verb>
$ irrecord myremote
</verb></tscreen>

Follow the on-screen directions to train your remote and define keys. If  
your remote ends up working well, you should consider submitting your  
<tt>lircd.conf</tt> file back to the lirc developers. Once finished:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# cp myremote /etc/lircd.conf
</verb></tscreen>

now try to start lircd again:
<tscreen><verb>
# /usr/local/sbin/lircd
</verb></tscreen>

Now, we're going to add the commands necessary for lircd to run each time we
boot. Mandrake 9.1 users, you can execute:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# chkconfig --level 35 lircd on
# exit
</verb></tscreen>

All other distributions:
<tscreen><verb>
# cd /etc/rc.d
# cat >> rc.local
echo "Starting lircd"
/usr/local/sbin/lircd
^D
# exit
$ 
</verb></tscreen> 

This takes care of the lircd portion, which "listens" for the IR signals. If
everything went well, the install script for lircd put an appropriate
configuration file for your remote into <tt>/etc/lircd.conf</tt> This file
maps the buttons on the remote control to the IR pulses coming from the
receiver.

The next step is to convert those signals into something that can be used
to control MythTV.  MythTV now includes native support for lirc and can
interact directly with 

<tscreen><verb>
$ cd ~/mythtv-0.17/configfiles
$ cp lircrc.example ~/.lircrc
</verb></tscreen> 
or
<tscreen><verb>
$ cp lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv ~/.lircrc
</verb></tscreen>
if you've got a Pinnacle Studio PCTV remote.
<tscreen><verb>
$ irw
</verb></tscreen>
Start pressing the keys on your remote; <bf>irw</bf> will
print the name of the button as it is defined in your
<tt>/etc/lircd.conf</tt>. If you don't see anything at this point, you need
to troubleshoot further by going back to the lirc home page and investigating
from there.

If it is working, then press <bf>CTRL-C</bf> to abort the program.  Once you
know that your remote is working, you can either recompile MythTV with
native lirc support (edit the <tt>settings.pro</tt> file and remove the "#"
from the lirc option, then make <tt>distclean</tt> and <tt>make</tt>) or you
need to run the <bf>irxevent</bf> program, which takes the key presses and
sends them to MythTV.  If you use native lirc support, you don't need to run
<bf>irxevent</bf>.  If you are going to use irxevent, then you need to run
it like this:
<tscreen><verb>
$ irxevent &
</verb></tscreen>
If <bf>irxevent</bf> isn't running, then MythTV will not respond to your remote
control unless you're using native lirc support.

<sect1>Additional information for lirc
<p>Take a look at the lircrc.example files in the <tt>configfiles/</tt>
directory.  In my case, (Pinnacle Studio card) the channel up and down functions
weren't working, due to the fact that the button names were different than
the default <tt>lircrc.example</tt> file that came with MythTV.

The <tt>lircrc.example</tt> file has this:
<tscreen><verb>
begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = ChannelUp
    config = Key Up CurrentWindow
end

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = ChannelDown
    config = Key Down CurrentWindow
end
</verb></tscreen>
but the <tt>/etc/lircd.conf</tt> that comes in the lircd package 
defines the buttons for the Pinnacle Studio PCTV as:
<tscreen><verb>
          channel+                 0x0000000000000017
          channel-                 0x000000000000001C
</verb></tscreen>
rather than "ChannelUp" and "ChannelDown".  I added the 
following to my /home/[yourusername]/.lircrc file:
<tscreen><verb>
begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = channel+
    repeat = 3
    config = Key Up CurrentWindow
end

begin
    prog = irxevent
    button = channel-
    repeat = 3
    config = Key Down CurrentWindow
end
</verb></tscreen>
which took care of basic functionality.  Because the PCTV Studio remote
has additional buttons, look at the
<tt>configfiles/lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv</tt> for an example of how
to define additional buttons, and how to debug potential button name
conflicts between the <tt>lircrc.example</tt> file and how <bf>your</bf>
remote defines the button names.

By examining the button names defined in <tt>/etc/lircd.conf</tt> and using
the <bf>irw</bf> program to make sure that your remote is working, you can
create the appropriate mappings in <tt>.lircrc</tt> to get excellent remote
functionality with MythTV.

Note the <bf>repeat =</bf> parameter.  This informs the <tt>irxevent</tt>
program to pass through every third keypress.  By default, <tt>lirc</tt>
will only send one keypress to the application, even if you're holding down
the key.  The actual <bf>repeat =</bf> number will vary from system to
system, so experiment and see which value works best for you.

<sect1>Configuring lirc for use with an IR blaster
<p>
<!-- By Carlos Talbot, <url url="mailto:carlos@talbot.net"> -->
Lirc has support for various IR transmitters. A popular model is the Actisys
IR-200L <url url="http://store.snapstreamstore.com/accessories.html"
name="http://store.snapstreamstore.com/accessories.html">. It was
originally designed for IRDA communication, but can be used to transmit A/V remote
control codes. By using the lirc SIR driver, this device can easily be
integrated with MythTV. I have tested this device with an AT&amp;T DCT2000
digital cable box but the instructions can be used to configure other IRDA
devices and A/V remotes.

Follow the steps in the previous section.  When you run setup.sh, select
option 1, driver configuration. From here select option 6, IrDA hardware.
Select your appropriate device and the corresponding serial port, then Save
configuration & run configure from the main menu. Once configure is done
type:
<tscreen><verb>
$ make
</verb></tscreen>

Please note: unlike the Pinnacle receiver above you will be compiling lircd
in addition to a kernel module for the SIR transmitter. Depending on whether
you have your serial port driver configured as a kernel module you might see
the following message during make:
<tscreen><verb>
lirc_sir.c:56:2: warning: #warning
"******************************************"

lirc_sir.c:57:2: warning: #warning "Your serial port driver is compiled into "

lirc_sir.c:58:2: warning: #warning "the kernel. You will have to release the "

lirc_sir.c:59:2: warning: #warning "port you want to use for LIRC with:"

lirc_sir.c:60:2: warning: #warning "setserial /dev/ttySx uart none"

lirc_sir.c:61:2: warning: #warning
"******************************************"
</verb</tscreen>

If you do receive this statement make sure to run the <bf>setserial</bf> command
before you load the lirc_sir module. Follow this with the install:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# make install
</verb></tscreen>
 
You will notice that lirc installs the kernel module in
<tt>/lib/modules/uname -a/misc</tt>. 

The configuration for starting <bf>lircd</bf> differs if you're going to be
sending and receiving IR versus just receiving.
<tscreen><verb> 
# cd /etc/rc.d
# cat >> rc.local
echo "Starting lircd"
setserial /dev/ttySx uart none        # (if required)
modprobe lirc_sir
/usr/local/sbin/lircd
^D
# exit
$ 
</verb></tscreen>
 
At this point you have to populate the <tt>/etc/lircd.conf</tt> file with the proper
codes for your A/V remote. You should be able to find your remote within the
lirc remote tar file located at <url
url="http://www.lirc.org/remotes.tar.bz2"
name="http://www.lirc.org/remotes.tar.bz2">. In my case I
extracted the file from remotes/motorola/DCT2000 (gi-motorola-dct2000)

To test the lirc_sir module you can run <bf>irw</bf> to verify the codes are being
received. If everything is configured correctly
you should see something similar to the following:
<tscreen><verb>
$ irw
0000000000007ff0 00 1 gi-motorola-dct2000
000000000000bff8 00 2 gi-motorola-dct2000
000000000000f7f0 00 ENTER gi-motorola-dct2000
</verb></tscreen>
 
Once you've verified lirc is working you can press <bf>CTRL-C</bf> to exit
<bf>irw</bf> and configure the channel changing script.
 
The path to the channel changing script will need to be entered on the
mythbackend setup screen for Input Connections.

This csh script will be called each time MythTV needs to change the channel.
Below is a copy of the script followed by the corresponding perl script.
Make sure both are in your path. Also make sure you leave the #!/bin/csh
setting and not change it to Bourne or bash. This will create a frustrating
symptom to diagnose where MythTV cannot open /dev/device. Unlike Bourne or
bash, csh scripts automatically close parent file descriptors before they
start.
<tscreen><verb>
$ cd /usr/local/bin
# su
# cat > change_channel.csh
#!/bin/csh
echo "changing to $1"
/usr/local/bin/channel.pl $1 &
^D
# chmod a+x change_channel.csh
# exit
$ exit
</verb></tscreen>
 
See <tt>contrib/channel.pl</tt> for the actual file.  Copy it to
<tt>/usr/local/bin/</tt>
 
The last statement within the perl script is the lirc rc command. This is
the command that transmits the code to your cable/DSS box. Make sure to have
the IRDA device within a few feet of the box.

if this directory doesn't exist, or it exists and you don't have write
privileges to it then MythTV will fail when you attempt to make a recording. 
The following example is specific for <tt>/var/video</tt>, but the same
instructions would apply if you want to keep the default but don't have the
directory structure setup yet.  See the <ref id="advancedpartitionformatting"
name="Advanced Partition Formatting"> section for hints on creating a
partition for MythTV.

If you create a <tt>/var/video</tt> subdirectory, change
<tt>/mnt/store/</tt> to <tt>/var/video/</tt> in the setup screens.
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# mkdir /var/video
# chmod a+rwx /var/video
# exit
</verb></tscreen>

The first thing to configure is the Master backend system.  If you are
running multiple backend systems, the Master backend will make all
decisions about which programs will be recorded on which tuners.  If you
have only one backend, then it will be its own master.

The Master backend will always choose the first available tuner in the same
order as you add cards through "setup". In other words, the second card you
add will only be used when there are two overlapping recordings, the third
when there are three, and so on. Therefore, you will want to have the
greatest amount of disk space on the Master backend because its tuner will
always be the first choice. You will then want to add your <ref
id="nonmaster_backend" name="other backends"> in the order of your
preference for recording.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="warning.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="warning.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  It is possible to <em>not</em> have the cards on the Master
backend be the first ones used.  However, if you are new to MythTV it is
easier to configure the Master backend first before moving on to the Slaves,
at least until you become more familiar with the MythTV system.  See <ref
id="advanced_backend_config" name="Advanced Backend Configurations"> for
information on configuring multiple backend systems in various ways.
</caption>
</figure>

Because MythTV now uses a database to store all configuration variables,
part of the bootstrap of MythTV is to indicate the location of the MySQL
database server. If the frontend, backend and MySQL database server are all
going to be running on the same box, you can continue to the next step.  If
not, you'll need to change the Host Name in the "Database Configuration"
screen of the mythfrontend program.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  Users that have been running the frontend and the backend on
different machines have stated that they have been having issues with remote
access to the MySQL database.  The following instructions may or may not
work.  Add the following to <tt>/etc/my.cnf</tt> on the backend machine and
restart MySQL.

</verb></tscreen>

Switch to the setup directory and run the setup program:
<tscreen><verb>
$ cd setup
$ ./setup
</verb></tscreen>

The backend setup program will start and offer you a number of choices.  It
is <em>strongly</em> recommended that you go through them in order.

The first question will ask if you wish to clear out your existing
configurations for your capture cards.  Initially, you should say "YES" so
that there are no surprises later.

The next question will ask you if you wish to clear out your video source
information.  You should answer "YES" to this as well.

Once the graphical setup starts, you'll see that there are five choices.
<enum>
<item>General
<item>Capture Cards
<item>Video Sources
<item>Input Connections
<item>Channel Editor
</enum>

Use the arrow keys to move around, and press the space bar to select which
option you wish to configure.

<sect2>General
<p>The first screen of the General configuration deals with IP addresses of the
system that you're running setup on and any master backend you may have.  If
you've only got one machine, then the default values are fine and you can
move to the next page by pressing the space bar.  If you need to move around
the screen, use the arrow keys to move focus between settings, not the
mouse.

If you will be deploying multiple backends, or if your backend is on one
system and you're running the frontend on another machine then <em>do
not</em> use the "127.0.0.1" IP address.

<bf>NOTE</bf>: If you modify the 127.0.0.1 address and use a "real" IP
address, you must use real IP addresses in both fields, otherwise your
frontend machines will generate "Unexpected response to MYTH_PROTO_VERSION"
errors.

It is very strongly discouraged that you make any changes to the port
settings from the defaults.

Once you're satisfied with the values, move the focus down to Next and hit
the space bar.

The next screen details the Host-specific Backend setup.  This is where you
will set the specific directory paths for this particular backend.  Make
sure that you've followed the steps at the beginning of this section and
created a directory that exists and that MythTV will have write privileges
to.  When you're done, press Next to continue, taking you to the Global
Backend Setup.

On the Global Backend Setup configure your backend with the appropriate
settings.  Use the left and right arrow keys to iterate through the choices
available on each setting, and the up and down keys to move between
settings.  Move to Finish when you're done and press the space bar, taking
you back to the main configuration screen.

<sect2>Capture Cards
<p>You should have no capture cards defined, so the highlight will be on
(New Capture Card).  Press space to begin.

Choose the appropriate settings for your particular tuner.  Use the arrow
keys to move around and to make your choices, and press RETURN when
complete.  Pressing RETURN will take you back to the Capture Cards screen;
if you have additional capture cards in this machine, press the space bar
when the highlight is on the (New Capture Card) row to define another card. 

If you have made a mistake, you can delete a card by highlighting it and 
pressing the 'D' key, or you can highlight it and press the RETURN or 'E'
key to edit it.

Once you have no additional cards to setup, press ESC.

<sect2>Video Sources <label id="VideoSources">
<p>When you start, the highlight should be on (New Video Source).  Press the
space bar to begin.  The first field asks for the name of the video source.
You may choose something easy to remember, like "Antenna" or "Cable".  Once
you've chosen a name, press the down arrow to move to the next field.  

If you're in North America, change the grabber to "DataDirect", then
continue pressing the down arrow to move to the next field.  Fill in the
username and password that you have established with DataDirect, then move
to the "Retrieve Listings" button and press the space bar.  

<bf>NOTE</bf>: You need <bf>wget</bf> version 1.9.1 or higher to use
DataDirect.

The setup program will contact the Zap2It servers and get your account
information.  Once you're done, you may click the Finish button and skip the
next few paragraphs in this document since they only apply to users that are
using the external XMLTV script to get their guide data.

If you wish to continue using the XMLTV grabber, then move to the Zip/postal
code field and put in the appropriate value.

If you're outside of North America, then some manual interaction will be
required with XMLTV.

Once you have chosen your provider, press RETURN to continue.  XMLTV will
now begin collecting the initial data for your location.  The screen may
blank for a few seconds to several minutes, depending on the load of the
listings provider and the speed of your connection to the Internet.  Be
patient!

You will then be returned to the Video Sources screen.  If you have multiple
video sources available, such as Antenna, Cable, etc, go ahead and define
them all, even if they're not all going to be physically connected to the
master backend server.  Once you're done, press ESC to return to the main
screen.

<sect2>Input Connections
<p>The final configuration item is Input Connections.  On this screen, you will
associate the various video sources you defined earlier with a physical
input to a encoder card.  It's entirely possible that you have multiple
tuners, and each tuner has a different input, so on this screen you let
MythTV know which device will connect to which input source.

When you start this screen, you should see a listing of the various input
connections available on each of the Capture cards you defined earlier.  For
example, you may have a capture card with a tuner, a SVideo and a Composite
connection.  If you wanted to associate the tuner (a.k.a., "Television") with
an "Antenna" source you defined in Video Sources, you would move to the
/dev/videodevice (Television) -> line and press the space bar.  Using the
left and right arrow keys will show you the various choices you have already
created for video source.  In our case, you would use the left/right cursor
keys until "Antenna" was shown in the Video Source field.  Press down to
move to the next setting, all of which should be self-explanatory.

Once you're done, press RETURN to go back to the Input Connections screen. 
You would then finish associating the video sources to any other hardware
devices you have available.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  Don't add a video source to a hardware input if you don't
actually have anything connected there.  For example, adding "Cable" to the
Tuner and to the Composite inputs without having something connected to
Composite will lead to blank recordings.
</caption>
</figure>

Press ESC to return to the main menu, and press ESC again if you have no
further items to configure, thereby returning you to the command line.

<sect2>Channel Editor
<p>The channel editor is used to globally alter channel information,
including items like hue, contrast, finetuning and others.  Users in North
America shouldn't run the channel editor until after completing initial
setup and running <bf>mythfilldatabase</bf> at least once to populate the
database.

<sect1>Post-configuration
<p>Run the <tt>mythfilldatabase</tt> program as directed.  The master
backend will obtain guide data for all the video sources you defined during
setup.

<bf>NOTE</bf>: If you are using DataDirect and watching the output messages
on the console or the log file it is normal to see a "401 Unauthorized"
error followed by a "200 OK" when the connection to Zap2It is being
established.

Once <tt>mythfilldatabase</tt> has finished, start the master server before
continuing.
<tscreen><verb>
$ mythbackend
</verb></tscreen>

mythbackend will print information about connections and what it's doing to
the console.  If you'd like to see the options that are available for
mythbackend, type <tt>mythbackend -h</tt> for help.

As of 2003-10-03, the available options are:
<tscreen><verb>
$ mythbackend -h
Valid options are:
-l or --logfile filename       Writes STDERR and STDOUT messages to filename
-p or --pidfile filename       Write PID of mythbackend to filename
-d or --daemon                 Runs mythbackend as a daemon
-v or --verbose debug-level    Prints more information
                               Accepts any combination (separated by comma)
                               of all,none,quiet,record,playback,
                               channel,osd,file,schedule,network
--printexpire                  List of auto-expire programs
--printsched                   Upcoming scheduled programs</verb></tscreen>

Running mythbackend as a daemon and using the logfile option will allow you
to have mythbackend automatically start up during the boot process.  For
example, you may add this to your <tt>rc.local</tt> file, or you can follow
the steps outlined in the section called <ref id="mythbackend_autostart"
name="Automatically starting mythbackend at system boot time">.

<sect1>Configuring a non-master backend <label id="nonmaster_backend">
<p>Ensure that you've granted access to the master MySQL database for remote
backends as discussed in the section titled <ref id="modify_perm_mysql"
name="Modifying access to the MySQL database for multiple systems"> and that
you have the correct IP address for the database server in the "Database
Configuration" screen of the setup application on this slave backend.

Make sure that the IP addresses on the General setup screen are accurate. 
If the slave backend can't communicate with the master backend due to IP
address misconfiguration then MythTV will not function properly.

Configuration of a non-master backend follows the same general procedure
as that of the master backend, with the exception that you skip over the
"Video Sources" step.  All possible video sources need to be defined on the
master backend system; only the master backend will query a listings
provider to obtain guide data for all the non-master backends.

</figure>
<bf>mythfilldatabase --help</bf> will give a full listing of the options
available.  

<bf>mythfilldatabase --manual</bf> is another option; the manual option will
allow you to fine tune channel frequencies and specify which channels will
be added to the database.  If you are not using the tv_grab_na grabber, you
must use the <bf>--manual</bf> option.

<bf>mythfilldatabase --file</bf> is an option if there isn't an XMLTV grabber
for your country, but you <bf>do</bf> have an XML formatted listings file
created by some other program.

<bf>mythfilldatabase --xawchannels</bf> is an option if you have used
<bf>xawtv</bf> to fine-tune your channels and would like to import the fine
tuning offsets into MythTV.

<bf>mythfilldatabase --refresh-today</bf> will only pull guide data for
today (in case of late-breaking changes to the schedule).

<!-- get more information on the manual setting -->

<sect2>Periodically running <bf>mythfilldatabase</bf>
<p>In order to keep your database filled, <bf>mythfilldatabase</bf> should be
run once a day.

There are three ways to accomplish this:  use the built-in capability of
MythTV to run the <bf>mythfilldatabase</bf> program, as a user-based cron
job, or as a system based cron.  If you use a user-based cron, you can
select the time that the cron job will be run.  A system-based cron job will
run at the same time as any other system cron jobs.

<sect3>Using the built-in method.
<p>To use MythTV's built-in capability, you'll need to run the
<bf>mythfrontend</bf> Setup option.  From the MythFrontend, enter the
Setup>General screen and advance to "Mythfilldatabase", the fourth screen.
Select the checkbox, then complete the options as you see fit.  The
<bf>mythbackend</bf> program will now run <bf>mythfilldatabase</bf> at the
times you specify.

<bf>NOTE</bf>:  Don't use the built-in and cron methods at the same time. 
If you switch to the native method, ensure that you've removed any user or
system cron jobs that you may have been using.
<sect3>Using the cron method.
<p>If you are a Mandrake 9.0 user and wish to use a system cron job, you can
perform the following steps:
<tscreen><verb>
$ cd configfiles
$ su
# cp mythfilldatabasecron /etc/cron.daily
</verb></tscreen>

If you want to know what time your job will run, you can do the following:
<tscreen><verb>
# cat /etc/crontab
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
MAILTO=root
HOME=/

# run-parts
01 * * * * root nice -n 19 run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
02 4 * * * root nice -n 19 run-parts /etc/cron.daily
22 4 * * 0 root nice -n 19 run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
42 4 1 * * root nice -n 19 run-parts /etc/cron.monthly
# exit
$ 
</verb></tscreen>
We can see from the display that the cron.daily job will run at 0402 every
morning.

If you wish to specify a custom time, then the user-based cron job is the
better method.

The default <bf>configfiles/mythcrontab</bf> file will run the
<bf>mythfilldatabase</bf> program every day at 0430.  Placing a copy of the
default <bf>configfiles/mythcrontab</bf> into your <tt>~/.mythtv</tt>
directory will allow you to edit your copy and maintain the original if you
get into trouble. To change the time used to start the
<bf>mythfilldatabase</bf> process, open the <tt>~/.mythtv/mythcrontab</tt>
file in your favorite editor and modify it as you like.  Once you're
satisfied with the time that <bf>mythfilldatabase</bf> will run, save and
exit, and return to the shell prompt.

<tscreen><verb>
$ cp ~/mythtv/configfiles/mythfilldatabasecron ~/.mythtv
$ cp ~/mythtv/configfiles/mythcrontab ~/.mythtv
$ cd ~/.mythtv
$ crontab mythcrontab
$ crontab -l  NOTE: this is a lowercase L.
# The following will run the mythfilldatabase shell script at 0430
# every day.  Format is
# minutes hour day_of_month month day_of_week
# man 5 crontab for more information
# Need to use a shell script because the QTDIR environment variable isn't
# being honored by crontab?
# The next text should be all on the same line.
30 04 * * * /bin/bash $HOME/.mythtv/mythfilldatabasecron
$ 
</verb></tscreen>

As you can see, <bf>mythfilldatabase</bf> will now be run at 0430
every day.

If you decide to alter the time that the <bf>mythfilldatabase</bf> runs,
you can use the crontab command to open your existing job and edit it in
place.
<tscreen><verb>
$ crontab -e
</verb></tscreen>

The <bf>crontab -e</bf> command will allow you to edit the existing crontab.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  By default, the crontab will use <bf>vi</bf> as your
editor.  If you don't like to use <bf>vi</bf>, make sure that you've set
<tt>VISUAL</tt> to something other than <bf>vi</bf>.
</caption>
</figure>
<tscreen><verb>
$ export VISUAL=/usr/bin/joe
$ crontab -e
</verb></tscreen>

This will cause <bf>crontab</bf> to use <bf>joe</bf>, a visual editor that
uses the Wordstar command sequence.  You may use <bf>emacs</bf>, or any
other editor that you're comfortable with.  You may also add the
<tt>EXPORT</tt> command to your <tt>.bashrc</tt> or to the
<tt>/etc/profile.d/mythtv.sh</tt> file.
<sect1>Grabbing channel icons for DataDirect users
<p>While the DataDirect TV listings service has several advantages, it does
not support grabbing logo icons for the stations you receive. However, there
are utilities provided with MythTV which you may use to grab your initial
set of icons and to keep them updated if your lineups change.

First, you need to generate or obtain an XML file with the information for
your stations.

If you have XMLTV software installed, there is a perl script in MythTV's
<tt>contrib/</tt> directory which will generate this file for you. Run the
command:
<tscreen><verb>
$ perl mkiconmap.pl
</verb></tscreen>

You will be asked for your zipcode and the service that you use. If there
are no errors, the <tt>iconmap.xml</tt> file that you need for the next step
will be created.

If you do not have XMLTV software installed and do not want to install it
for the sake of this minor task, there is a generic
<tt>contrib/master_iconmap.xml</tt> which you can copy and use but this may
not be as complete as using the specific information for your service.

Once you have an <tt>iconmap.xml</tt> file, add the icon information to your
database and grab any new icons with the command:
<tscreen><verb>
$ mythfilldatabase --import-icon-map iconmap.xml --update-icon-map
</verb></tscreen>

<sect>Configuring mythfrontend.
<p>Once you have completed configuration of your backend systems, the next
step is to configure the frontend client.  

When you start mythfrontend for the first time, it will attempt to
connect to a configuration database on the local machine.  If there is none,
a "Database Configuration" screen will appear, and you will need to
fill in some details.  The "Host name" field needs the backend or
database server's IP address or DNS name, and the User or password fields
may need to be set to match your database user accounts.  After editing those
fields, press enter twice to write these configurations on your local machine,
and attempt to connect to the database.  If you make any mistakes, the screens
will pop up again.

Now that mythfrontend has started up,
you should have a number of buttons/choices.  Before
doing anything, go to TV, then to Setup and configure the frontend client.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  You should go through the various setup screens in
mythfrontend before using any other modules such as MythMusic, etc. to
correctly initialize the database.
</caption>
</figure>
<sect1>General
<p>The General screen has configuration items that don't really fit anywhere
else.  The first few configuration items asks you to indicate the number of
seconds to record before or after a program, which is useful if the
broadcast network or your system clock are out of sync and will help prevent
you missing the beginning or end of a program.  

To change the value, use the left and right arrow keys to increment and
decrement the number of seconds.  When you're satisfied with the result, use
the down arrow to put the input focus on the Next button or press RETURN to
continue to the next page.

The next page has a number of options to do with how channels are displayed
on your system.  The help text will give you more information.  Move the
focus to Next and press the space bar to continue.

The final General page sets up some final configuration items.  See the help
text for more information.

<sect1>Appearance
<p>This set of screens is mostly concerned with how MythTV will look on your
system.  From here, you can choose different themes and set the resolution
of your system.

<sect1>Program Guide
<p>Fairly self explanatory.  Note that the alternate program guide does not
use the same font settings as defined in Appearance, so if the EPG is
unreadable this is where you make the adjustments to fonts, number of
elements displayed, etc.

<sect1>Playback <label id="deinterlace_"> 
<p>The one configuration item which may cause problems on your system is the
"Deinterlace playback" setting.  MythTV uses a linear blend algorithm for
deinterlacing, which will improve how the image looks on your screen. 
Deinterlacing requires that your processor support SSE. (Streaming SIMD
Extensions, aka "MMX2").  Early Intel Celeron (those that don't use the
Coppermine 0.18um core and are usually <600MHz), Pentium Pro and Pentium II
CPUs do not have SSE, so make sure that you haven't enabled deinterlacing if
your processor doesn't support it. If you enable it, and your processor
doesn't support SSE, you will get "Illegal Instruction" errors.

To determine if you've got SSE on an Intel processor, you can:
<tscreen><verb>
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo
[snip]
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca
cmov pat pse36 mmx fxsr sse
</verb></tscreen>

Notice the <bf>sse</bf> at the end of the line - this tells you that this
processor will be able to deinterlace correctly.

On an AMD processor, look for "3dnow" in the cpuinfo line; "3dnow" is AMD's
implementation of SSE instructions, so if your processor has 3dnow you
shouldn't have any issues with deinterlacing.
<sect2>Video Filters
<!-- Submitted by Bruce Markey -->
<p>MythTV provides a facility to include video filters while recording and
during playback. These filters can be used to improve or modify the video
image, including hiding the effects of an interlaced image or reducing the
effects of noise in a poor video signal. The following is a brief
introduction to introduce you to the filters that are available in MythTV
version 0.17.
<sect2>Applying filters
<p>One or more filters can be included in a "filter chain". The filters to
be used are identified in a "filter string". A filter string is a group of
filter names and parameters separated by commas.  To include parameters, the
filter name is followed by "=" and the parameter information. There should
be no spaces in the filter string. Here is an example filter string:

With parameters: <tt>kerneldeint=10:1,denoise3d=12</tt>

Without: <tt>kerneldeint,denoise3d</tt>

Recording filters are set for each individual channel. These may be used
when encoding in software (MPEG-4, RTjpeg) but do not apply when using a
capture card with hardware encoding such as those supported by the ivtv
driver, DVB, HDTV or MJPEG cards. You can run MythTV's "setup" program and
select the "Channel Editor". On the first page for each channel, you can
enter a filter string in the box titled "Video filters". If you are running
"mythweb" on your web server, you can click on "Settings" then "Channels"
and enter filter strings in the "videofilters" column.

Playback filters are per-host and apply to any recording you watch from the
frontend where filters have been applied. Playback filtering can only
work with software decoding so the viaslice, xvmc, and ivtv outputs ignore
filters entirely. From "mythfrontend" go to Setup->TV Settings->Playback.
Enter your filter string in the box titled "Custom Filters".

<sect2>Currently Available Filters
<p>"Deinterlace Playback" checkbox.

This implements special behavior needed for the "bobdeint" filter but can
also be used to choose any of the deinterlace filters. If you prefer, you
may leave this unchecked and include any of the deinterlace filters, other
than "bobdeint", in your custom filter chain.

<p>o  The "invert" filter

Invert ignores any parameters and inverts the pixel values of the video
frames.  In other words, a negative image. This would rarely be useful but
may be a good example to verify that your filter strings take effect.

o  The "linearblend" filter

It is a simple deinterlacing filter that ignores parameters and works by
blending adjacent lines.  It replaces combing in interlaced video with a
less distracting "ghost" image.

o The "bobdeint" filter

This filter splits the interlaced image into two separate fields that
can be line doubled then displayed at twice the frame rate. If the
display is at the same refresh rate as the recording (59.92Hz NTSC or
50Hz PAL) this will cause each refresh to show objects in motion in
a new position with no jagged edges. However, if the display is not
synchronous, it will cause flickering or the appearance of the picture
moving up and down by one line.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>: This filter requires the frame rate to be doubled
and therefore can only be used with the "Deinterlace Playback" checkbox.

o  The "kerneldeint" filter

Kerneldeint is a more complex deinterlacing filter which applies a filter
kernel using input from several lines.  It generally removes combing without
a "ghost" image, sometimes leaving a faint outline of the image from the
other field. It is considered to be less distracting to watch than
linearblend or no filter at all. It accepts one or two integer parameters
separated by a colon.

The first parameter is the filter threshold and defaults to 12. Adjacent
lines differing by more than the threshold value are filtered. The second
option defaults to 0.  If set to a non-zero value, it will cause the filter
to skip chroma, and filter only the luminance.  It may be useful on some
capture cards which do not capture the chroma fields of interlaced video
correctly.

o The "onefield" filter

This is a simple one-field deinterlacing filter that uses only one field of
the interlaced video.  By default it keeps the top field, though passing the
parameter "bottom" will cause it to keep the bottom field instead.

This filter is primarily useful for those who display 1080i HDTV signals
with a video mode that has 540 pixels vertically.  The advantage over other
deinterlacing filters is that scenes with motion never show combing or
ghosting.

o The "adjust" filter

This filter adjusts the digital values for luma and chroma to ensure that
they will fall within the ranges specified in the ITU-R601 standard. By
default, this corrects a known problem for the luma range used by bt8x8
chips which causes video to look washed out. If parameters are passed, there
need to be exactly six. However, passing a single parameter of "-1" will
disable the filter.

1: luma minimum input value (int)
2: luma maximum input value (int)
3: luma gamma correction (float)
4: chroma minimum input value (int)
5: chroma maximum input value (int)
6: chroma gamma correction (float)

The default bt8x8 correction values are equivalent to
"16:253:1.0:2:253:1.0".  Output ranges are fixed at ITU-R601 values (16-235
luma, 16-240 chroma).

<bf>NOTE</bf>: If it is not already specified in the filter chain, this
filter will be automatically applied when recording with the "bttv" driver.

o  The "quickdnr" filter

A fast temporal denoiser. This can take 1, 2 or 4 parameters, each being a
value from "0" for the least filtering to "255" for the greatest filtering.
With one parameter, the filter will compute the values it should use for all
of its variables. Two parameters will set the filter strength for luma and
chroma independently. If you are interested in how the algorithm works, you
may examine the source code to see how four parameter are used.

o  The "denoise3d" filter

A slower denoiser that applies a spatial and temporal low-pass filter. The
spatial filter can remove some noise that quickdnr can't, but a more
powerful CPU is needed.  This filter accepts 3 float parameters:

<itemize>
<item>luma spatial filter strength
<item>chroma spatial filter strength
<item>luma temporal filter strength
</itemize>

Reasonable defaults will be selected for omitted parameters.  The chroma
temporal filter strength is calculated from the other filter strengths.

o  The "crop" filter

Covers edges of video with black bars.  This helps improve video quality
when the edges of the frame are distorted. By default, this removes 16
pixels from each edge. This can optionally take four parameters representing
top:left:bottom:right. The number times 16 is the number of pixels to remove
so, for example, the default is "=1:1:1:1".

o  The "forceyv12" and "forceyuv422p" filters

These force the filter manager to use the given format.  You can use one of
these at the head of a filter chain to change the capture format. The most
likely use would be forceyuv422p to use YUV422P capture on cards with known
chroma interlacing problems with YV12.

There are some filters included in the MythTV source code that should 
not be used:

o  The "forcergb24" and "forceargb32" filters

The two RGB formats should not be used because there is no conversion filter
for them yet.

o  The "convert" filter

It exists but don't use it.  The filter manager uses this filter
automatically when it is unable to match the input/output formats of two
adjacent filters.

o  The "postprocess" filter

While this exists in MythTV source code, it is currently not recommended for
use.

<sect2>Usage Considerations
<p>There are trade-offs to consider when deciding if it would be wise to use
a filter. Any processing will modify the original image so you should assess
if the filter has made a noticeable improvement to the picture in order to
justify the impact of the processing.  Adding any filter will inherently
increase CPU usage. The impact can vary dramatically depending on your CPU
type and speed, the resolution of the recording, which filters you are using
and other factors. You can only determine what is right for you through
experimentation. However, as a starting point, here are some filter strings
that you may find useful:

For typical broadcast stations:	"kerneldeint,quickdnr"

For stations with poor signal quality: "linearblend,denoise3d=12"

For synchronous TV-out: check Deinterlace with "Bob (2x framerate)"
 
<sect1>Recording 
<p>Depending on your capture card, MythTV offers different video encoders. 
The following types of hardware encoding cards are supported:
<itemize>
<item>MJPEG - Zoran-based cards; see <url url="http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net" name="http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net">
<item>MPEG-2 - iTVC15/16 based cards (Hauppauge PVR-250/PVR-350); see <url
url="http://ivtv.sourceforge.net" name="http://ivtv.sourceforge.net"> 
<item>HDTV - pcHDTV cards; see <url url="http://pchdtv.com" name="http://pchdtv.com"> and
the Air2PC-ATSC-PCI see <url
url="http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=103"
name="http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=103">
<item>DVB - cards supporting DVB; see <url url="http://linuxtv.org" name="http://linuxtv.org">
</itemize>
For cards without hardware encoding capabilities (all cards supported by
V4L not listed above), Myth includes two methods for software encoding:
RTjpeg and MPEG-4.  RTjpeg has significantly fewer CPU demands than MPEG-4,
but it generates larger files than MPEG-4 for a given recording.

For DVB and HDTV cards, no further configuration is required after
setting up the card using the 'setup' program.
For all other cards, configuration is done through MythFrontend. 
Selecting 'Recording Profiles' from the 'TV Settings' screen will list
the profiles currently available for the cards in your system. 
Depending on what types of cards you have installed you may see:
<tscreen><verb>
(Create new profile group)
Software Encoders
Hardware MPEG Encoders
Hardware MJPEG Encoders
Transcoders
</verb></tscreen>
The '(Create new profile group)' option will allow you to create custom
profiles in case you have multiple backends.  Note that custom profiles
are per backend and card type.  If you have 2 MPEG-2 encoders in a given
backend system, creating a custom profile will affect both of them.  This
option should not be needed otherwise.

The 'Transcoders' group is a little different from the others.  Selecting
this group will result in a menu with the following options: 'RTjpeg/MPEG-4'
and 'MPEG-2'.  These types indicate what transcoder options will be used for
a given input type (i.e. the 'MPEG-2' settings would be used to transcode
MPEG-2 files into MPEG-4.  The source of the MPEG-2 stream (DVB, HDTV, or
PVR-x50) does not matter. Configuration of the options is the same as below
(although any resolution settings will be ignored).

Selecting any of the other options will show a new screen with a list of
four profiles:
<itemize>
<item>Default
<item>Live TV
<item>Low Quality
<item>High Quality
</itemize>

The Default profile will be used for any recording which does not otherwise
have a specific profile assigned. The 'Live TV' profile will be used when
watching TV.  The remaining two profiles are available for customizing to
allow for more precise control over what quality is used for a given
program.

Selecting a profile will allow you to adjust the relevant options for that
card.  The most significant setting is the recording resolution, but you can
also choose encoding format, audio format, and tweak other encoder specific
properties.

<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>: although the width and height can be changed to almost
anything, if you start MythTV and don't see video or you get "segmentation
fault" errors, it is likely that the video4linux (v4l) subsystem did not
like the height and width parameters specified.  It's best to leave the
default as-is until you're sure that MythTV is operational.

<sect1>Xbox Frontends
<p>MythTV is able to control the LED on the Xbox to indicate backend
recording status.  

To control the LED, you will need the <bf>blink</bf> program from the
xbox-linux project, which is installed as <tt>/bin/led</tt> on GentooX.  On
Xebian (the new Ed's Debian) you must install it yourself.  On other
distributions it may or may not be installed as a program called
<bf>blink</bf> and should be located in your path.  (Type <tt>which
blink</tt> to see if the program is available.) If you do not have
<bf>blink</bf>, you may obtain it from the Xbox-Linux project site at <url
url="http://xbox-linux.sf.net/" name="http://xbox-linux.sf.net/">. The
program you need is part of the <tt>eds_i2c_staff</tt> module in CVS.  Note
the spelling.

Once you have installed <bf>blink</bf> you will need to set permissions. 
<bf>blink</bf> needs write permission to the i2c device to function
properly.  There are three methods to accomplish this.  First, you could run
<tt>mythfrontend</tt> as root, which is the simplest method, but could
potentially be a security risk.  Next, you may make the <bf>blink</bf>
binary setuid root, which allows non-privileged users to run a program with
root capability.  This is done by typing the command:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# chmod u+s /path/to/blink
</verb></tscreen>
The final technique would be to set the <tt>/dev/i2c/0</tt> device read/write
for all users, but this is the least preferred method.

Now it's time to setup MythTV for Xbox hardware.  Enter Setup -> General. 
On the second page check the 'Enable Xbox Hardware' option.  Upon reentering
the settings, you should have a new option named 'Xbox'.  Within this option
you may select the distribution, LED colors for recording and the update
interval.  If you select GentooX as the distribution <bf>led</bf> will be
used as the <bf>blink</bf> binary name, otherwise, <bf>blink</bf> is used. 
Colors should be self explanatory.  The update interval determines how often
the frontend should poll the backend to determine if the status has changed.

<caption><bf>NOTE to Red Hat/Fedora users</bf>:Red Hat Linux and Fedora Core
ship with Gnome as
the default desktop environment.  However, Gnome seems to have issues with
window focus and window switching which sometimes cause mythfrontend to
obscure the video. KDE does not seem to have any such issues. Therefore you
will need to switch to KDE by selecting RedHatMenu>Extras>System

If you are using MythTV with just a remote control then it is suggested that you
map the remote control keys as described below.  Your remote control may not
have the same set of keys as those named below, the names are only a suggestion
that roughly correspond to the function.
<p>
If you are adding new key bindings to the program then consideration of this
suggested list will help users with remote controls.
<p>
This list assumes a minimal remote control that only has 20 keys, nearly all
features can be used with this configuration.  If you have more keys then you
can access all of the features.  With only 16 keys most features are usable.

<sect1>Using themes with MythTV
<p>MythTV is "themeable", meaning that the visual appearance of the program
can be modified by the user without re-compiling or altering the program
functionality.  The MythTV website has a Themes section; pick a theme you'd
like to use and download it to your system.

Once it's on your machine, you must move the file and untar it:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# cp funhouse.tar.gz /usr/local/share/mythtv/themes
# cd /usr/local/share/mythtv/themes
# tar -xzf funhouse.tar.gz
# exit
</verb></tscreen>

The theme will now be available in the mythfrontend Appearance section.

<sect1>Adding DirecTV information to the database
<p>A script for adding DirecTV information into the database has been
written by tarek Lubani <url url="mailto:tarek@tarek.2y.net"> and is
available at <url url="http://tarek.2y.net/myth/ppv.pl"
name="http://tarek.2y.net/myth/ppv.pl">.  This is currently an external
user-supplied program, so if you have issues with the script, please contact
the author.

<sect1>Adding support for an external tuner
<p>MythTV supports changing the channel on an external tuner.  If you have
an external tuner, such as a DirecTV or digital cable set top box, you
should add <tt>/usr/local/bin/changechannel</tt> to your Input Connections in the
mythbackend configuration GUI.

The <bf>changechannel</bf> program is not supplied with MythTV, so this is
going to be dependent on what sort of external tuner you have.  Example
scripts for Sony and RCA receivers can be obtained from <url url="http://tarek.2y.net/myth/"
name="http://tarek.2y.net/myth/">.  This is currently an external
user-supplied program, so if you have issues with the script, please contact
the author.

<sect1>Using Shutdown/Wakeup
<p>What does the MythTV Shutdown/Wakeup function do? The scheduler on the
Master backend (MBE) keeps track of the idle status of the entire MythTV
system, including the Slave backends (SBE). If it considers the system to be
idle, and thus ready to shutdown, it sets the wakeuptime to the time of the
next recording and then proceeds to shut down all Slave backends and then
itself. Once it is time to begin recording, the Master backend and the Slave
Backends are automatically woken up.  This system allows MythTV to record
like a normal VCR, thereby conserving power when not in active use.

In order to use the Shutdown/Wakeup function there must be some method of
waking up the Master backend.  There are any number of solutions, but we
will discuss in detail two possibilities:

<itemize>
<item>Use another server that runs 24/7 and have it send a WakeOnLAN (WOL)
packet to wake the Master backend.  This assumes that you have the WOL tools
installed, and that your Master backend motherboard supports WOL.
<item>Use your motherboard's BIOS wakeup capability.  You'll need a motherboard
that supports BIOS wakeup, and some tools.  Two that work are: <url
url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nvram-wakeup"
name="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nvram-wakeup"> and <url
url="http://www.malloc.de/tools/wakeup_clock.html"
name="http://www.malloc.de/tools/wakeup_clock.html">
</itemize>

<sect2>A deeper look into the operation
<p>The scheduler keeps track of the idle status of the MythTV system. To
determine whether or not the MythTV system is idle, the following conditions
must be met for a period of time defined in the "Idle timeout (secs)"
parameter.
<itemize>
<item>no client is connected to the server
<item>no recording (neither LiveTV nor a regular recording) is currently taking place
<item>no recording starts within a definable amount of time ("Max. wait for recording (min)")
<item>the "pre Shutdown check-command" returns 0 
</itemize>

If we get to this idle state the Master backend will set the wakeuptime using the "Set
wakeuptime command", which is the same for WOL and BIOS wakeup. The Master backend will
then shut down the Slave backends and itself using the "Server halt command".

One caveat is that the scheduler tries to guess if the Master backend was started by a
wakeup call or by the user. If it thinks it was woken up by a user, it
blocks shutdown until a client connects to the Master backend, after which it will
behave as described above. To disable this feature, unset "Block shutdown
before client connected" in the mythfrontend Setup->Setup->General screen.

Once it is time to startup the system, the Master backend is woken up first and will
wakeup the Slave backends using the "Wake command for slaves". At this time, there is
no support for starting only the required Slave backend, so all Slave backends will startup.

<sect2>Setting up the MythTV side of this extension.
<p>There are a number of options that are used to control the Shutdown /
Wakeup feature.

Shutdown/Wakeup Options:
<itemize>
<item>"Idle timeout (secs)" is the time the server waits while idle until a
shutdown occurs.
<item>"Max. wait for recording (min)" is the time the Master backend waits for a recording
without shutting down. For example, this would be used to prevent a 10
minute system shutdown if a recording is set to start 15 minutes from now.
<item>"Startup before rec. (secs)" Sets how long before a programmed
recording the MythTV system will be woken up.  This should be roughly be the
time your systems need to bootup, and if you have Slave backends, you'll
need to ensure this value is long enough for all your machines to perform
their bootup cycle.
<item>"Wakeup time format" is the format of the wakeup time that is given in
the "Set wakeuptime command" as a parameter "$time". You need to set this
according to your wakeup mechanism. If you need secondss since the epoch
(1970-01-01) set the "Wakeup time format" to "time_t".
<item>"Set wakeuptime command" is the command executed to set the new wakeuptime. 
<item>"Server Halt Command" is the command executed to shutdown the Master
backend and the Slave backends.
<item>"pre Shutdown check-command" is an optional command used to give a
"Go/NO-GO" decision from a non-MythTV source.  This command is executed
immediately before the shutdown would occur. The return value is use to make
the following choices:
<itemize>
<item>If it returns a "0" the shutdown will occur as scheduled.
<item>If it returns a "1" the "idle timeout" will be reset and the system
waits again for the timeout.
<item>If it returns a "2" the entire shutdown sequence is reset.  This means
that a new client connect is needed before a shutdown occurs, unless you have
the "Wait for client connect" setting disabled, in which case this is the same as
returning "1".  An example of a use for this return value is to prevent the shutdown
if a user is currently logged in, or if a specific program (ie. transcode,
automatic updates, etc.) is currently running. If you don't need it, leave
the field blank.
</itemize>
</itemize>

The "WakeOnLan settings":
These settings have nothing to do with using BIOS or WOL wakeup, they are
the same for both.
<itemize>
<item>"Master backend" This setting defines timings for the frontends to
wakeup the Master backend using WOL. Useful if your frontend can emit a WOL
packet so you don't need to physically go to the Master backend if you're
trying to watch TV.
<item>"Reconnect wait time (secs)" is the time the frontend waits after
executing the "Wake command" before attempting to retry the connection. This
should be roughly the amount of time your Master backend needs for bootup.
Set to "0" to disable. The frontends will retry to connect for "Count of
reconnect tries" times before giving up.
<item>"Wake command for slaves" is the <em>one</em> command executed to wake
your Slave backends. This should be a script that contains the calls to
wakeup all Slave backend systems.
</itemize>

<sect3>Using WOL to wake your Master backend. 
<p>To use WOL to wake your Master backend you will need a WOL capable Master
backend, a machine that runs 24/7 which can execute an at-job and nc (netcat)
on the Master backend. I use some little bash scripts to make my DSL router
wakeup my mythbox if required.

Replace $SERVER and $PORT with your own settings!
On my Master backend I have a script that gets called as 'setwakeuptime command' which
looks like the following:
<tscreen><verb>
#! /bin/sh
echo $@ | nc $SERVER $PORT
</verb></tscreen>
This simply cats the parameters (that is $time) to my 24/7 server. On my
$SERVER I have (x)inetd listening on $PORT starting a little script which
cares about setting the at-job. The following additions are necessary on the
$SERVER:

If you use <bf>inetd</bf>:
<p>In <tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt> add:
<tscreen><verb>
mythwake stream tcp nowait mythtv /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/bin/mythwake
</verb></tscreen>
If you use <bf>xinetd</bf>, save the following as <bf>mythwake</bf> in your
<tt>/etc/xinet.d/</tt> directory:
<tscreen><verb>
service mythwake
  {    
	socket_type     = stream
	wait            = no
	user            = mythtv	
	protocol        = tcp
	id              = mythwake
	server          = /usr/local/bin/mythwake
  }
</verb></tscreen>
and add the following to <tt>/etc/services</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
mythwake        $PORT/tcp
</verb></tscreen>

Finally, <tt>/usr/local/bin/mythwake</tt> looks like:
<tscreen><verb>
#! /bin/bash
#this should be a command to wake your server
WAKECMD="#!/bin/sh\n /usr/local/bin/wakeMBE"
#first we need to delete all wake jobs in queue
for JOB in atq | cut -f 1 ; do
    atrm $JOB;
done
#now we read the date from 'nc'
read date;
#now set the atjob
echo -e "$WAKECMD" | at $date ;
</verb></tscreen>
<bf>SECURITY WARNING</bf>:
Be sure to secure $SERVER:$PORT from untrusted networks, because this
allows 3rd parties to run arbitrary code on your server!

<sect3>Using BIOS wakeup to wake your Master backend.
<p>Since I don't use this, I cannot say much about this. If your motherboard
supports any wakeup tool you have to call that tool as "Set wakeuptime
command" with the "Wakeup time format" suitable for that tool.
<sect2>Wakeup the MySQL server using WOL
<p>If your MySQL server and your Master backend are not on the same machine,
you can have the Master backend wake your MySQL server using WOL. You will
find the settings for this in the second page of the setup program,
or at the end of mysql.txt.  The meanings are the same as
discussed in "The WakeOnLan settings" above.

<sect2>Tips/Tricks:
<p>If, for example, one of the Slave backends is also your desktop computer,
you could simply use a little script as 'server halt command' which first
calls <tt>/sbin/shutdown -t TIMEOUT</tt> where TIMEOUT is a value sufficient
for you to react.  You could then popup a window using *dialog, asking for
permission to shutdown. If you cancel the shutdown, simply call
<tt>/sbin/shutdown -c</tt>.

If you get "nvram-wakeup: /dev/rtc: Device or resource busy" your
set-wakeuptime-script should stop the program that uses <tt>/dev/rtc</tt> before
setting the wakeuptime.

<sect1>Scheduling Recordings
<p>The MythTV master backend is responsible for managing the schedule
for all TV tuner cards on the master and any slave. It's job is to
search the TV listing for the shows you have requested and assign
recordings to the TV tuner cards. If none of the shows that you've
chosen overlap, it simply records all of the shows. However, if
there are shows where the beginning and end times overlap, the
scheduler follows rules that you've specified or makes logical
decisions about what would be best if you haven't express your
preference. Further, the "Upcoming Recordings" page allows you make
specific decisions about what you really do and don't want to
record.

<sect2>Record Types
<p>When you choose a show that you would like to record from the
Options Page, there are eight different types of rules to help the
scheduler find which showings you would like to record.

<itemize>
<item>Single Record -- record only this title at this specific
time. This is the best way to be sure that a certain showing is
recorded. However, if the TV listings change and the show is not
broadcast at that time, the show will not be recorded.

<item>Find One -- this will record a title once from any of the times
that appear in the TV listings. This is useful for recording a movie
or special that has multiple showings because it allows the scheduler
to choose one that doesn't conflict. It is not a good choice for
recording a single episode of a series because it records the first
available showing of the title without regard to the episode
information.

<item>Record Weekly -- this records a show whenever the title is listed
on the same channel, weekday and time. Note that if the TV station
changes the schedule for a special episode, it would not be
recorded. However, you can add a Single record for the special
episode.

<item>Find Weekly -- this will record a title once per week from any
of the times that appear in the TV listings beginning from the time of
the showing that was selected when the rule was set. This is useful
for news, current events or other programs where the same episode is
shown several times each week but the listings may not include
descriptive information. This is not a good choice if there are
different episodes shown during the week.

<item>Record Daily -- this records a show whenever the title is listed
for the time and channel on any day of the week. Here again, a show
will not be recorded if the time was altered by the station.

<item>Find Daily -- this will record a title once per day from any
of the times that appear in the TV listings beginning from the time of
the showing that was selected when the rule was set. This is useful
for news, current events or other programs where the same episode is
shown several times each day but the listings may not include
descriptive information. This is not a good choice if there are
different episodes shown during the day.

<item>Channel Record -- records a show anytime the title is listed on
this channel.  This is perhaps the most common rule to use for most
shows.

<item>Record All -- record this title on any channel at any time. This
can be useful if a station has sister stations where shows are
rebroadcast allowing the scheduler to record rebroadcasts on the other
station when the original airing cannot be recorded.
</itemize>

<sect2>Duplicates
<p>Singles will record without regard to duplicate matching.

<p>The standard recurring methods of All, Channel, Weekly and Daily use
the descriptive information in the TV listings to try to record only one
showing of each unique episode. However, This goal is sometimes
complicated by the fact that the stations may not include a description
for a specific episode but use a generic description for the series
instead. When there is a generic description, the default behavior is to
assume that it may be an episode that you have not seen and to record it
for you.  One of the duplicate matching options is "Record new episodes
only".  If this is selected, listing that have an original air date of
more than 14 days earlier are considered repeats and are not eligible to
record. Generally, generic episodes will be marked as repeats also.

<p>Because of generic episodes and other situations, MythTV offers an
alternative approach where shows may be recorded by choosing from
multiple showings even when the descriptive information is not reliable.
All of the "Find" record types look for matching titles in the
listings. If there is a showing with specific episode information and
that episode has recorded before, that showing is marked as previously
or currently recorded. The scheduler will then choose to record the
earliest non-conflicting showing from any of other remaining showings
regardless of the descriptive information. Generally, Find One is most
useful for movies or specials and the Find Daily and Find Weekly rules
are best for news or current events shows that are repeated. However,
these may be useful in other situations where the standard recording
rules may not work correctly.

<sect2>Conflicts
<p>As you add more shows that you would like to record, the scheduler
will eventually encounter conflicts. If there are two shows at the
same time and you have two or more TV tuner cards, both shows will
record. However, if there are more shows than cards, the scheduler
will have to decide what it thinks it should not record based on the
information you have given. If you see an unexpected situation you
are not "stuck" with the scheduler's choice. You can still tell the
scheduler exactly which shows you do want to record and/or don't
want to record in any situation.

<sect2>Priority
<p>By default, all shows you select are have equal value to the
scheduler.  There are a set of rules to to make good choices when
two or more shows are in conflict. However, priority values let the
scheduler know what you want so that it can set the schedule based
on your preferences.

Initially all priority values are set to zero. You may choose to
leave everything at "0" and let the scheduler follow rules to guess
what you might prefer when there are conflicts. However, if you have
one or two favorite shows, you may want to increase the priority
value so the scheduler will know that you would prefer recording
these over other shows. You might use certain values to rate shows
so that all favorites are 2. good shows are 1 and extra 'filler'
shows are all -1 for example. You could sort each title on the "Set
Priorities" to have a unique value so the scheduler can always know
which show you'd prefer verses any other show. The choice and style
are entirely up to you. However, the more information you give to
the scheduler, the more likely it will make the choices you would
like in the first place.

The scheduler choices are based on the total priority for a showing
by adding up four different priority factors. By default, all of
these factors are "0" but you may use any combination to express
your likes and needs.

Per record rule -- this is the "priority" field in the "Scheduling
Options" section of the options page and this values is included for
any showings that match the recording rule.  You may choose to only
use these values and not use the other factors for the sake of
simplicity and clarity.

Per record type -- Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->General
allows you to add to the priority based on the type. It may make
sense to increase the value for "Single" so that by default they
have an extra advantage over other shows. You may want to decrease
the value for Find rules so that they will be less likely to interfere
with regular shows and will be more likely to record in a
non-conflicting time instead.

Per channel -- Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->Channel
Priorities can be useful if you believe that you prefer any of the
shows on certain channels. This would give all shows on a channel an
advantage by default.

Input preference -- in the MythTV "setup" program, the "Input
Connections" section allows you to add additional priority in the
"Input preference". This is simply another priority factor but has an
interesting effect. If a card input has a higher value than the other
cards, the scheduler will see that you would rather record showings of
episodes on this card rather than a showing on another card. If you
have multiple cards of different quality, you may want to set input
preference to encourage the scheduler to record shows on your best
card(s) whenever possible. This can also be useful if you have
multiple video sources which include the same stations. For example,
with digital and analog cable you could increase the digital cable
input preference by 1 to tell the scheduler that you want to record
from the digital station whenever possible but the station on the
analog input could still be used when the digital input is busy.

For any single showing of any show you've chosen to record, these
factors are added together to find the "total priority". This is the
priority that the scheduler uses to decide which shows are given the
first choice when filling in the schedule.

<sect2>Scheduling decisions
<p>Here are the actual decisions made by the scheduler as it fills in the
schedule.

<itemize>
<item>Currently recording beats not currently recording -- A recording in
progress can not be moved so it "wins" it's current timeslot.

<item>Higher total priority beats lower total priority -- This is the core of
the scheduling process. Episodes of the highest priority show are placed
on the first available card then the next highest priority and so on.

<item>Future start time beats passed start time -- If there is an
episode in progress and also a later showing of the same episode, it
is better to record the complete episode. If there isn't another
showing, start recording now to record the remaining portion.
This should only happen if you add a new rule while the show is in
progress or if the master backend is started after the start time of
a scheduled show.

<item>More specific record type beats less specific record type -- If
two shows are on at the same time and have the same total priority but
different types they will be sorted by Single then Find One, Record
Weekly, Find Weekly, Record Daily, Find Daily, Channel and finally
All. This only applies if the priorities are the same.

<item>If both start times have passed, later start time beats earlier
start time -- This attempts to miss the least amount of time.

<item>If neither start time has passed, earlier start time beats later
start time -- This rule help assure that the earliest showing of an
episode has the advantage.

<item>Lower input id beats higher input id -- The scheduler fills in
open time slots on the first available card. The next cards is used
when there is another show already placed for the first card.

<item>Older record rule beats newer record rule -- If two shows are
still equal after all of these other checks, the show whose record
rule was added first is preferred over a more recent addition.
</itemize>

<sect2>Reschedule Higher Priorities

<p>Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->General has a checkbox for
"Reschedule Higher Priorities" which tells the scheduler to try to
be a little smarter in certain situations. If this is checked, the
scheduler will look for situations where a show cannot record
because all inputs for the channel are used for higher priority
shows. It will check to see if any of the other shows could be
recorded at another time so that the conflicting show can be
recorded in it's place.

Generally, this is a good strategy but there are tradeoffs. If a
higher priority show is postponed, you will not get to watch it
until it is recorded in the later timeslot. There is also a risk
that the TV listings may change and the later showing may go
away. In this rare case the higher priority show may never
record. On the other hand, if you do not use this option you will
miss recording some lower priority shows unnecessarily unless you
make similar these changes manually.

By using Reschedule Higher Priorities, the scheduler will do a
better job of recording as many of your shows as possible when left
unattended. It will also be easy to see that shows have been marked
to record at a later time. You can then decide for yourself when you
would prefer to record the first showing.

<sect2>Controlling Your Schedule
<p>
The Manage Recordings->Upcoming Recordings page is your control
center for the MythTV scheduler. Unlike other DVR systems, this one
page gives you all of the information and tools you need to see all
of your alternatives and make whatever adjustments you desire.

The upper half of the screen has a scrollable box listing items that
match your record rules sorted by time. The lower half shows the
details for the highlighted item. There are two 'views' available.
Press "1" to include all of the items that match record rules even
if they do not need to be recorded. Press "2" to focus on just the
things that will record and items that may need your attention. The
message in the upper right-hand corner will remind you when there
are conflicts that would prevent one or more shows from being
recorded.

The items in the list are colored white for things that will record,
gray for those that do not need to record and yellow when there is a
time conflict. Items at the top of the list may also be highlighted
indicating that the recording is in progress.

Along with the channels, start times and titles, the right-hand
column has a status code. Numbers indicate which card number has
been assigned to record the show. Letters are used to indicate the
reason that something will not be recorded. Just below the box is a
short status message for the highlighted item that indicates the
type of record rule that was matched and a one or two word
explanation of the status code. If you press SELECT, you will see
more information about the status.

There are a few status codes that may require your attention. "C"
indicates that there are more overlapping shows to record than there
are TV tuners to record them. "L" indicates that the scheduler found
that it may be better to record a later showing of this
episode. These states happen as a result of your choices and should
normally reflect your preferences. However, you may notice situations
where you would like to modify the scheduler's initial choices.

The first thing you can do is to highlight an item and press INFO
once or twice to see the Recording Options page. From this page you
can change the record rule type, the duplicate matching rules, or
raise or lower the priority to resolve whatever problem you noticed.

Additionally, you can treat any individual showing as an exception
that you do want to record or don't want to record. To use these
"override" features, highlight the item and press SELECT. You will
see a message explaining the current status and at least an "OK"
button to exit without making changes.

For items scheduled to record, there will be a button for "Don't
record" which will prevent recording this showing but will still
allow the same episode to record in the future. If there is episode
description information, you may also see a button for "Never
record".  This prevents recording this showing and tells MythTV to
remember that this is an episode that you've seen or don't need to
see if it is ever in the TV listings again.

For items that are not scheduled to record, the message will
describe the reason and in the case of "C" or "L" it will include a
list of the shows that are scheduled to record instead. For any item
that could potentially be recorded there will be buttons for "Edit
Options" and "Add Override". "Edit Options" will allow you to change
the options for the existing record rule such as raising the priority
so that the show will record. These changes would apply to this and
all future showings that match this record rule. "Add Override" will
allow you to set options that apply to the specific showing without
affecting the existing record rule.

If you return to an override page after an override has already been
set, you will also see a "Clear override" to undo your changes. This
option makes it very easy to try out some "what if" attempts when
deciding on your best strategy in a difficult situation.

<sect>MythWeb.
<p>The MythWeb allows you to use a web page to control various
aspects of your MythTV system.  MythWeb is a separate application, but it's
dependent on MythTV being installed and operational.

<sect1>Installation and prerequisites
<p>Download mythweb from <url url="http://www.mythtv.org/"
name="http://www.mythtv.org/"> and save it to a location where you can find
it.  The next step depends on whether your distribution has a web server and
if you have PHP support.

<sect2>Mandrake 9.0
<p>Mandrake 9.0 has <bf>apache</bf> and <bf>PHP</bf> pre-packaged, so
installation is quite simple.  Once you have installed the two programs,
either with the graphical installer (see instructions in <ref
id="graphicinstalltools_" name="Graphic Install Tools">) or through the
command line (section <ref id="CLIinstalltools_" name="Command Line">), and
you've ensured that the <bf>apache</bf> server will start at boot using the
Mandrake Control Center.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>: Mandrake 9.1 users, perform the following:
</caption>
</figure>
<tscreen><verb>
# urpmi apache2 apache2-mod_php php-mysql
# chkconfig --level 345 httpd on
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Completing the installation
<p>
<tscreen><verb>
$ tar -xjf mythweb-0.17.tar.bz2
$ cd mythweb-0.17
$ su
# mkdir /var/www/html/mythweb
# cp -r . /var/www/html/mythweb
# exit
$ 
</verb></tscreen>

Edit the <tt>/var/www/html/mythweb/config/conf.php</tt> file if required.

By default, MythWeb uses an Apache <tt>.htaccess</tt> file to restrict
access to the website and to configure some variables.

To create the password file for Apache (if your system doesn't already have
one), you could do something like this:
<tscreen><verb>
# cd /var/www
# htpasswd -c htpasswd mythtv
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user mythtv
</verb></tscreen>

See the man page for <bf>htpasswd</bf> for more examples.

To access the web page, open a web browser and use <bf>http://[name or ip
address]/mythweb/</bf>

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>: Make sure that you have a trailing slash on the URL,
otherwise you will get a <tt>404 Page not Found</tt> error.
</caption>
</figure>
<sect1>Resetting the key binding table.
<p>MythWeb allows you to configure which keys are bound to which actions
within MythTV.  If you'd like to reset this back to the default, execute the
following command:
<tscreen><verb>
$ echo "delete from keybindings ;" | mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg
</verb></tscreen>
<sect>MythGallery.
<p>MythGallery is a photo and slideshow application.  MythGallery is a
separate application, but it's dependent on MythTV being installed and
operational.
<sect1>Installation and prerequisites
<p>Download MythGallery from <url url="http://www.mythtv.org/"
name="http://www.mythtv.org/"> and save it to a location where you can find
it.  There are a number of transitions available, some requiring OpenGL
support.  You will also need to install a TIFF library.  Under Mandrake, you 
would perform the following command:
<tscreen><verb>
# urpmi libtiff3-devel
</verb></tscreen>
Once you have satisfied the prerequisites for your distribution, download
and install the application:
<tscreen><verb>
$ tar -xjf mythgallery-0.17.tar.bz2
$ cd mythgallery-0.17
$ ./configure --enable-opengl
$ qmake mythgallery.pro
$ make
# su
# make install
# exit
$ 
</verb></tscreen>
The configuration for MythGallery is accessed through the main Setup option
in mythfrontend.  Make sure you set your pictures directory to wherever
you're storing your photos.

The controls for MythGallery can be found in the README that comes with the
application.
<sect1>Using MythGallery
<p>When you first start MythGallery, you will see a thumbnail view of any
folders and pictures in the Gallery Directory you specified in setup.  If
this is the first time you have accessed this directory, the thumbnails will
be generated on the fly.  If the Gallery Dir is writable, these thumbnails
will be cached thus speeding up future access.  On the left is a greyed-out
menu of options.

Use the arrow keys to select a folder or picture to open/view with the
Select key, or use the Menu key to toggle access the menu on the left.  The
menu options are as follows:
<itemize>
<item> Slideshow - Will cycle through all the pictures in the current folder. 
The currently selected item must be a picture (not a folder) for this to
work.  It does not currently traverse subfolders.
<item> Rotate CW - Rotate the current image 90 degrees in the clockwise
direction.  This change persists if the current directory is writable.
<item> Rotate CCW - As above except the direction of rotation is counter(anti)
clockwise.
<item> Import - Import pictures into your Gallery Dir.  This option is
described in the next section.
<item> Settings - Access the MythGallery settings screen.
</itemize>
<sect1>Importing Pictures
<p>The import path in the setup dialog is a colon separated list of
directories and/or executable files.  When the import key is pressed, a new
directory (the destination directory) under the current directory will be
created and the import path will be searched.  If the item in the import
path is a directory (the source directory), the contents of that directory
will be copied to the destination directory. If you would like the source
directory to be that of a removable device, it might be a good idea to use
autofs.  See the automount howto at <url url="www.linuxdoc.org"
name="www.linuxdoc.org"> for info on how to get it working.

If the item in the import path is an executable file, MythGallery will
attempt to execute it with the destination directory as its sole argument.
Be careful when using executable scripts that the script runs unattended
(doesn't need user intervention) and returns properly, otherwise it could
create the appearance of MythGallery hanging (e.g. running
<bf>smbclient</bf> and prompting for password).  Also be sure that scripts
have executable permissions set.

Here is an example script that a user may want to run
on import: 
<tscreen><verb>
#!/bin/csh

if ($#argv == 0) then 
        echo "Usage: $0 dest_dir" 
        exit 
endif 

cd $argv[1]

# get stuff over the network
wget http://www.somesite.dom/dir/file1.jpg 
wget http://www.somesite.dom/dir/file2.jpg
wget http://www.somesite.dom/dir/file3.jpg

# stuff that requires manual module loading and/or fs mounting
modprobe camera_module
mount /dev/camera /mnt/camera
cp /mnt/camera/* $argv[1]
umount /mnt/camera
rmmod camera_module

# perform some processing
foreach pname (`ls *.jpg`)
        jpegtran -flip vertical $pname > $pname.new
        mv $pname.new $pname
end

<sect>MythGame.

<sect>MythMusic.  
<p>MythMusic has a number of prerequisites that must be satisfied before it
is operational.  Depending on your distribution, some of these prerequisites can
be satisfied through the various package managers.  If your distribution doesn't
offer pre-compiled versions of the software below, then follow the generic
instructions for manually compiling and installing the software.

The prerequisites for MythMusic are:
<itemize>
<item>MAD
<item>id3tag
<item>libvorbis-devel
<item>FLAC
<item>libcdaudio
<item>CDParanoia
</itemize>

<sect1>Manual installation of prerequisites
<p>These instructions are for distributions which don't have pre-compiled
versions of the software necessary to run MythTV.

Download MAD from <url url="http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/"
name="http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/">  Save it to a directory you
can find later.
<tscreen><verb>
$ tar -xzf mad-0.14.2b.tar.gz
$ cd mad-0.14.2b
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit
$ 
</verb></tscreen>

Download libid3tag from <url url="http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/"
name="http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/"> Save it to a directory you can
find later.

<tscreen><verb>
$ tar -xzf libid3tag-0.15.0b.tar.gz
$ cd libid3tag-0.15.0b
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit
$ 
</verb></tscreen>

Download FLAC from <url url="http://flac.sourceforge.net"
name="http://flac.sourceforge.net"> and install:
<tscreen><verb>
$ tar -xzf flac-1.1.0.tar.gz
$ cd flac-1.1.0
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit
$ 
</verb></tscreen>

Download libcdaudio from <url name="libcdaudio.sourceforge.net"
url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=27134"> and
install:
<tscreen><verb>
$ tar -xzf libcdaudio-0.99.9.tar.gz
$ cd libcdaudio-0.99.9
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit
$ 
</verb></tscreen>

Download cdparanoia from <url name="http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/down.html"
url="http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/download/cdparanoia-III-alpha9.8.src.tgz">.
<tscreen><verb>
$ tar -xzf cdparanoia-III-alpha9.8.src.tgz
$ cd cdparanoia-III-alpha9.8
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
# make install
# cd /usr/lib
# ln -sf libcdda_interface.so.0.9.8 libcdda_interface.so
# ln -sf libcdda_paranoia.so.0.9.8 libcdda_paranoia.so
# exit
$ 
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Mandrake 9.0
<p>Mandrake 9.0 has a number of the prerequisites available on the
installation CD.  Some of the software you're going to need will have to be
obtained from the "contrib" or "cooker" development repositories. 
Applications downloaded from "cooker" come from the development branch, so
there may be issues with some software.  It isn't recommended that you mix
cooker and release-level software.

<p><bf>urpmi</bf> is the simplest tool for installation of packages from the
command line.  The difficult part is the configuration, but this has been
made easier at the following website: <url
url="http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php"
name="http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php"> The website will allow
you to choose a mirror site and then present the command-line configuration
text for that mirror.  You will most likely need to add a "Contrib" mirror
to your setup.  Once you have done that, you can proceed.  If <bf>urpmi</bf>
prompts you about other modules that need to be installed to satisfy
dependencies, say "Yes".

<tscreen><verb>
# urpmi libmad0 libmad0-devel libflac4 libflac4-devel libcdaudio1 cdparanoia
# urpmi libcdda0 libcdda0-devel libvorbis0 libvorbis0-devel
# urpmi libcdaudio1-devel libid3tag0 libid3tag0-devel
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Additional options with MythMusic
<p>Additional visualizations have been added to MythMusic.  If you wish to
use these, there are some prerequisites you must install prior to compiling.

<itemize>
<item>fftw
<item>OpenGL
<item>SDL
</itemize>

<tt>fftw</tt> may be obtained from <url url="http://www.fftw.org/"
name="http://www.fftw.org/">.  In Mandrake 9.1 it may be installed by
typing:
<tscreen><verb>
# urpmi libfftw2 libfftw2-devel
</verb></tscreen>

<tt>OpenGL</tt> should be installed on practically all distributions. 
However, you will need the devel module.  In Mandrake 9.1 it may be
installed by typing:
<tscreen><verb>
# urpmi libMesaGLU1-devel
</verb></tscreen>

<tt>SDL</tt> may be obtained from <url url="http://www.libsdl.org"
name="http://www.libsdl.org">.  In Mandrake 9.1 it may be installed by
typing:
<tscreen><verb>
# urpmi libSDL1.2 libSDL1.2-devel
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Red Hat Linux 9
<p>Red Hat provides packages for several of the prerequisites, making 
installation very simple. Of the prerequisites, Red Hat provides 
packages for Vorbis, cdparanoia, SDL, and OpenGL (which you probably 
already have installed). To install these all at once, simply type (all on
the same line):
<tscreen><verb>
$ up2date --solvedeps libvorbis libvorbis-devel vorbis-tools cdparanoia-devel cdparanoia-libs cdparanoia SDL-devel SDL
</verb></tscreen>

If you get the following message: "None of the packages you requested 
were found, or they are already updated" it probably means you already 
have all of those packages installed.

You must install the remaining packages, (MAD, FLAC, libcdaudio and
optionally fftw) manually following the installation directions above. When
installing fftw do not use the rpm package offered on the website because it
will cause an error, so use the source package instead.

<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>: you can use the instructions given at the <ref id="atrpms"
name="automated installation section"> to install all of MythMusic in one
step.
</caption>
</figure>
<sect1>Compiling MythMusic
<p>Once all the prerequisites have been installed, you can proceed with
getting MythMusic going. Make sure that you run <tt>./configure</tt> first. 
If you wish to use the new visualizations, make sure you install the
prerequisites.  Run <tt>./configure --help</tt> for help.

<code>
NOTE for Red Hat users: Before compiling, make the following modification 
to settings.pro, otherwise the compile will fail:

Find the following text:
INCLUDEPATH *= /usr/local/include

immediately below that add
INCLUDEPATH *= /usr/include/cdda

save and close settings.pro and proceed with compiling MythMusic.
</code>
<tscreen><verb>
$ qmake mythmusic.pro
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit
$ ./configure
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Configuring MythMusic
<p>Configuration of MythMusic occurs in two places.  The main mythfrontend
Setup is for global MythMusic configuration.  Go to the
Setup/MythMusic/General Setup screen and adjust it for your particular
setup.

The second configuration screen is within the MythMusic program and will
allow you rescan your music library, etc.

Here's some explanation about the Ignore_ID3 and The NonID3FileNameFormat:

If Ignore_ID3 is set to TRUE, MythMusic will try to determine the
Genre, Artist, Album, Track Number, and Title from the filename of the
mp3 file.  The NonID3FileNameFormat variable should be set to the
directory/file format where the mp3 files are stored.  For instance, I
store mine in the above shown Genre/Artist/Album/Track format.  MythMusic
will then use this information to fill in the proper fields when it
populates the musicmetadata table rather than searching for an ID3 tag in
the mp3 file.

The files can be laid out in any format, such as:

Genre/Artist/Album/Title
Artist/Genre/Album/Title
Artist/Album/Title (with Genre left as Unknown)

The track number is optional but can be specified with the title by using
the TRACK_TITLE keyword instead of TITLE.  If TRACK_TITLE is used,
then the filename can have a space, hyphen, or underscore separating the
track number from the track title.  Keywords are case insensitive, so if
you specify GENRE it's the same as Genre in the format field.

The Ignore_ID3 option does not disable the code that determines the track
length, just the portion that tries to read ID3 info.

<sect1>Using MythMusic
<p>MythMusic is fairly simple to use.  It is recommended that you insert the
CD before selecting "Import CD".  You should also ensure that your system
doesn't try to automount the CD and begin playing it automatically.

Another item to consider:  there are some CDs that contain computer data
that runs as a "CD Extra" when inserted into some Windows PCs and
Macintoshes.  As of 2003-06-10, MythMusic doesn't support track skipping or
individual track selection, so if you have a CD with "CD Extra" data you
will not be able to encode it; MythMusic will hang attempting to encode the
non-audio data.

Next stuff is from a message by jasonmiller [jasonmiller@micron.com]
with additional comments by Thor 
-->
Here's some information on playlist management:

Q: How do I create a new playlist?  
A: Using the MythMusic "Select Music" menu option, setup the playlist as you
normally would by adding songs or other playlists as needed.  When you are
ready to save the new playlist, highlight "Active Play Queue" at the bottom
of the selection tree and hit the "i" key. This will pop up a menu allowing
you to name and save the new playlist.  You can also hit Enter to bring up
the popup on the Active Play Queue. This does not work on the playlists
above, as Enter is obviously bound to checking/unchecking the boxes. Any
number (ie. keypad on remote) will also bring up the menu in both cases.

Q: How do I enter the playlist name in the text field without a keyboard?
A: Use the keypad number keys (bound to your remote) to select letters
quasi-cell phone style. Keys 2-9 work pretty much like any cell phone text
entry. 1 cycles through a few special characters, delete, and space. 0 is
like a CAPS LOCK. Hard to describe, fairly easy to use. You will soon be
able to specify the cycle timing in a Setup screen. You can type fairly
quickly through a combination of jumping around the number keys AND hitting
a non-number key (right arrow is particularly good for this) to force the
current character.

Q: How do I edit a playlist? 
A: Highlight the playlist in the selection tree and hit the "i" key then
select "Move to Active Play Queue" in the popup.  You can now modify the
"Active Play Queue" like normal, adding songs and playlists by selecting
them from the song tree.  When you are done, highlight the "Active Play
Queue" in the selection tree and hit the "i" key then select "Save Back to
Playlist Tree".  And whatever you were editing as your Active Queue before
you moved an existing playlist "on top" of Active reappears. Think of Active
has having a push on, pop off capability, but with a depth of only 1.

Q: How do I delete an item from a playlist?
A: Highlight the item in the selection tree and hit the "d" key.

Q: How do I rearrange the songs in my playlist?
A: Highlight a song and hit the "space" bar, the song will now have pair of
red arrows in front of it.  Use the up and down arrow keys to move it around
in the playlist.  When you have it where you want it, hit the "space" bar
again.

Q: How do I delete a playlist?
A: Highlight the playlist in the selection tree and hit the "i" key then
select "Delete this Playlist" from the popup.

<sect1>Troubleshooting MythMusic
<p>You may run into errors when running MythMusic.
<sect2>When I run MythMusic and try and look up a CD, I get an error message 
<p>The full text of the message will say: 

databasebox.o: Couldn't find your CD. It may not be in the freedb database. 
More likely, however, is that you need to delete ~/.cddb and ~/.cdserverrc
and restart mythmusic. Have a nice day.

If you get this message, you should go to the home directory of whatever
user MythMusic is running as and type:
<tscreen><verb>
rm .cdserverrc
rm -rf .cddb/
</verb></tscreen>

These files aren't automatically deleted because of a conscious design
decision by the author that programs that automatically delete things are
bad.

The files are used to locally cache CD lookups. If you are re-inserting
CDs, your machine will not actually have to go out to the Internet to
determine what is on them.  However, the URL used to access the freedb
database has recently changed, so the stale information in the files from
previous runs of MythMusic would cause the error above.  Once the files have
been deleted the stale information will be gone and your local database
will be rebuilt as you use CDs.

<sect>MythWeather.
<p>The MythWeather module will obtain the weather information for the
location that you specify.  You must be running MythTV v0.10 or later 
in order to use MythWeather.

Change into the MythWeather directory, then make and make install:

</verb></tscreen>

MythWeather uses MSNBC.com as its source for weather data and weather.com
for its radar image.

These are the keyboard commands for MythWeather:
<tscreen><verb>
Left Key             Goes back one page, and extends the time spent
                     on the page you are on.
Right Key            Goes forward one page, see above.
Space                Pause, wait on the current page until space is hit
                     again.
Numeric Keys         You can check other weather by keying in other ZIP codes.
Enter Key            Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Can also
                     be used a way to force a data update.
"m" Key              Resets the location to the database default, then updates the data.
"i"                  Enter / Save settings
ESC                  Exit the settings screen without saving / Exit the program
</verb></tscreen>

MythWeather also has an "Aggressiveness" setting.  This affects how long
MythWeather waits for data from the msnbc.com website before timing out.  If
you are on a slow connection, or have a slow DNS, or MythWeather just
doesn't seem to be working and you've already tried everything else, then
try increasing the aggressiveness level parameter.  This parameter is
inverse; a higher number actually means that MythWeather will be less
aggressive, and will therefore wait longer before timing out.

MythWeather will print debugging information on the terminal.  If you wish
to see additional debugging information while MythWeather is running, run
mythweather from the command line with as <tt>mythweather --debug</tt>

You may also force mythweather to re-run the configuration by starting it on
the command line as <tt>mythweather --configure</tt>.  These two options are
mutually exclusive.

<sect>MythVideo.
<p>The MythVideo application will allow you to use an external program to
watch media files that are not directly supported by MythTV.

Change into the MythVideo directory, then make and make install:
<tscreen><verb>
$ cd mythvideo
$ qmake mythvideo.pro
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit
</verb></tscreen>

See MythVideo's <tt>README</tt> file for additional information.

<sect>MythDVD.
<p>MythDVD is an application which rips DVDs and makes them available for
use with MythVideo.  You may also transcode the DVD content from MPEG-2 to
other formats which should greatly reduce the amount of space the DVD
material takes up on your hard drive.

MythDVD has a number of prerequisites to enable transcoding functionality. 
If you only wish to play DVDs rather than convert them to something like
MPEG-4 or xvid you may skip the prerequisite installation step.

<sect1>Manual Compilation of Prerequisites
<p>
<sect1>Pre-compiled binaries
<p>Mandrake users may install the prerequisites this way:
<tscreen><verb>
# urpmi libdvdread3 libdvdread3-devel a52dec liba52dec-devel 
# urpmi mplayer ogle xine
</verb></tscreen>
Assuming that you've added a PLF mirror, you may also load the rest of the
prerequisites using the following command:
<tscreen><verb>
# urpmi xvid xvid-devel fame libfame0.9-devel transcode libdvdcss
</verb></tscreen>

Next comes the configuration and compilation.  If you don't want to
transcode, then the first command in the next example can simply be
<tt>./configure</tt>
<tscreen><verb>
$ ./configure --enable-transcode
$ qmake mythdvd.pro
$ make
$ su
# make install
</verb></tscreen>
<sect1>Running the Myth Transcoding Daemon
<p>Transcoding ("ripping") a DVD requires you to run the Myth Transcoding
Daemon (mtd).  To ensure that mtd is configured correctly, you should first
test it at the command line.
<tscreen><verb>
$ mtd -n
</verb></tscreen>
The last line of text should show something like:
<tscreen><verb>
mtd is listening on port 2342
</verb></tscreen>
This indicates that mtd is ready for use.  Once you've successfully
tested mtd in the foreground, type <bf>CTRL-C</bf> to stop mtd.  You may
then start it as a background (daemon) process.
<tscreen><verb>
$ mtd -d
</verb></tscreen>

Running mtd as a daemon will allow you to automatically start it during the
boot process.  For example, you may add <tt>mtd -d</tt> to your
<tt>rc.local</tt> file, or you can adjust the script/steps outlined in the
section called <ref id="mythbackend_autostart" name="Automatically starting
mythbackend at system boot time"> to start mtd instead of mythbackend.

<sect>Troubleshooting.
<sect1>Compiling
<sect2>Compile errors
<p>Some compile errors are worse than others.  If you get an error that
doesn't abort the compilation, and says something like:
<tscreen><verb>
cc1plus: warning: changing search order for system directory
"/usr/local/include"
cc1plus: warning:   as it has already been specified as a non-system
directory
</verb></tscreen>
then it shouldn't be a problem.

If you get an error like <tt>/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXext</tt>, the
compiler is telling you that you don't have XFree86-devel installed, or that
your distribution hasn't set it up correctly.  This needs to be fixed before
MythTV will compile.

<sect2>error: can't find a register in class 'BREG' while reloading 'asm'
<p>This is due to the broken Qt that is being distributed by Suse.  To work
around this, edit <tt>libs/libavcodec/Makefile</tt> and remove any
"-fPIC" you find there and then recompile.

<sect2>make: *** No rule to make target /usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs/default/qmake.conf', needed by Makefile'.  Stop.
<label id="mkspecs_error">
<p>This error happens when there's a missing link in the
<tt>/usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs</tt> directory.  There are two ways to fix this
error:

1.  Create the link manually:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# cd /usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs
# ln -sf linux-g++ default
</verb></tscreen>
and then restart the compile,

or

2.  Run <bf>qmake mythtv.pro</bf> in the mythtv directory.  Rerunning
<bf>qmake</bf> will create a new Makefile for you, however this still
doesn't fix the root cause of the issue, which is that your distribution
didn't create the symlink for you when the qt3 package was installed.  The
first choice is the better solution.

<sect2>make: *** No rule to make target /mkspecs/default/qmake.conf', needed by Makefile'.  Stop.

<sect2>Internal Segmentation Fault.
<p>This is most likely to be caused by an overheating processor rather than
an actual programming fault within gcc.

<sect1>Debugging
<sect2>MythTV segfaults
<sect2>MythTV isn't doing anything
<sect2>Debugging with GDB
<p>Without details, the developers will not be able to determine if you have
discovered a genuine code-bug,  or if the problem is with your system.  In
order to determine what's going on, you must recompile MythTV with debugging
support and run MythTV within <bf>gdb</bf>, the GNU debugger.

Edit the settings.pro file.  Make sure that the top of the file looks like this:
<tscreen><verb>
$ cat settings.pro
CONFIG += debug
#CONFIG += release
</verb></tscreen>

Now, you need to clear out the old versions of the software to ensure that
you're running with the debugging code, then compile and install.
<tscreen><verb>
$ make clean distclean
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit
</verb></tscreen>

At this point, you now have debug-enabled software ready.  Let's assume that
the problem you're having is in the <tt>setup</tt> program.
<tscreen><verb>
$ cd setup
$ gdb ./setup

type 
<tscreen><verb>(gdb) thread apply all bt full
</verb></tscreen>

All of the output from gdb should be posted to the mythtv-dev mailing
list, along with the steps you followed to get the program to crash.

If you're trying to troubleshoot and you can't get back to the gdb window
for some reason, it may be easier to use two systems or to start
mythfrontend from the text console.

If you're going to troubleshoot from a remote system, connect to the machine
that you're going to test using <bf/ssh</> or <bf/telnet</>. Next, type
<tt>$ export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0</tt>.  This will allow the graphics to be
displayed on the X console (usually ALT-F6 or ALT-F7) and still give you
output and control of <bf/mythfrontend</>, either from the <bf/ssh</>
session, or by switching back to the text console by pressing CTRL-ALT-F1. 
You can now continue troubleshooting using <bf/gdb</> as detailed in the
instructions.

<sect2>Illegal Instruction
<p>This error can happen for the following reasons:
<itemize>
<item>You have an AMD K6-2 or VIA C3 processor.  If you have either of
these, make sure that you you followed the instructions in this <ref id="cpuspecificoptimizations"
name="section">.
<item>You have an early production Intel Celeron, Pentium Pro or Pentium II.  If you have any
of these processors, make sure that your <ref id="deinterlace_" name="deinterlace">
variable is set correctly.  Your CPU needs to support SSE instructions for
deinterlace support.  You may check this by doing a <tt>$ cat
/proc/cpuinfo</tt> and looking for "sse" in the processor flags section.
</itemize>

<sect2>MythTV is crashing your system
<p>When run as a non-privileged user, MythTV <em>can not</em> crash your
system.  If your system is crashing when you run MythTV, then you have some
issue with the drivers for your capture card or other hardware, or the CPU
fan has fallen off/broken and your system is overheating when asked to
perform a CPU intensive task like encoding video.

If you are running as root, which is <bf>strongly discouraged</bf>, it is
possible that your system may crash due to the real-time thread using all
available CPU.  You will not be able to interrupt the process, so for all
intents and purposes your computer will have crashed.

<sect1>Installing
<sect2>When trying to run setup, you get an error like this: "./setup: error while loading shared libraries:"
<p>You didn't add <tt>/usr/local/lib</tt> to <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf</tt>.  See the
section on modifying <ref id="modifying_ld.so.conf" name="/etc/ld.so.conf">.

<sect1>Using
<sect2>MySQL not connecting correctly
<p>Your <bf>MySQL</bf> installation may have networking turned off. 
Check that <tt>/etc/mysql/my.cnf</tt> <em>does not</em> contain
<tt>skip-networking</tt>.  If it does, remove it.  Also verify that 
<tt>bind-address</tt> is set to your IP address instead of 
<tt>127.0.0.1</tt>.  If you change either of these items, restart 
<bf>MySQL</bf>.

<sect2>MySQL database is corrupt
<p>If you have reason to believe that your MySQL database is corrupt,
execute the following commands to attempt to repair it.

<bf>NOTE</bf>: Ensure that there are no programs accessing the database
while you attempt to repair it.  Make sure that all backend and frontend
programs have exited.

<tt>mysqlcheck -r -umythtv -p&lt;password&gt; mythconverg</tt>

<sect2>Using a MPEG-2 encoder card and the video appears "jittery"
<sect2>Using a MPEG-2 encoder card and the video is jumping up and down
<p>This is a different problem than the one discussed in the previous
section.  Currently, the ivtv driver or firmware appear to have some issues
if the vertical capture resolution is not the full screen height.  If you
are having a jitter problem then ensure that you are capturing either 480
lines (for NTSC) or 576 lines (for PAL).  The default capture profiles may
need to be edited for your setup.  Go to Settings->TV Settings->Recording
Profiles and adjust the <bf>Default</bf> and <bf>Live TV</bf> options to
480 or 576 from their defaults.

<sect2>Screen goes blank but returns when mouse is moved or keyboard is used
<p>This is due to DPMS, the Display Power Management System, which is used
to save power by turning off your monitor when the system decides that it's
not being used or due to a screensaver that has defaulted to a blank screen. 
Since it's likely that watching TV will not generate keyboard or mouse
events for a time, you need to turn off DPMS and the screensaver.  There are
a few ways to do this.  You may also need to check your BIOS for power
saving modes and disable screen blanking there as well.

Edit your <tt>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</tt> file, and look for:
<tscreen><verb>
Section "ServerFlags"
    #DontZap # disable <Crtl><Alt><BS> (server abort)
    #DontZoom # disable <Crtl><Alt><KP_+>/<KP_-> (resolution switching)
    AllowMouseOpenFail # allows the server to start up even if the mouse doesn't work
EndSection
</verb></tscreen>

Add <tt>Option "NoPM" "true"</tt> and <tt>Option "BlankTime" "0"</tt> to the
ServerFlags section.

Also, look for:
<tscreen><verb>
Section "Device"
    Identifier "device1"
    VendorName "nVidia Corporation"
    BoardName "NVIDIA GeForce 256 (generic)"
    Driver "nv"
    Option "DPMS"
EndSection
</verb></tscreen>

In this case, you would need to either delete the <tt>Option "DPMS"</tt>
line, or change it to <tt># Option "DPMS"</tt> to comment it out.  The next
time you start XFree this change will take effect.

Finally, check:
<tscreen><verb>
Section "Monitor"
    Identifier "monitor1"
    VendorName "Plug'n Play"
    HorizSync 30-85
    VertRefresh 50-160

    # Sony Vaio C1(X,XS,VE,VN)?
    # 1024x480 @ 85.6 Hz, 48 kHz hsync
    ModeLine "1024x480"    65.00 1024 1032 1176 1344   480  488  494  563 -hsync -vsync

    # TV fullscreen mode or DVD fullscreen output.
    # 768x576 @ 79 Hz, 50 kHz hsync

    ModeLine "768x576"     63.07  768  800  960 1024   576  578  590  616
EndSection
</verb></tscreen>

Ensure that there isn't an <tt>Option "DPMS"</tt> in the Monitor
configuration.

You can also turn off DPMS from the Command Line, but this will not survive
a reboot.
<tscreen><verb>
$ xset -dpms
</verb></tscreen>

Using <tt>xset +dpms</tt> will turn it back on.

Another technique to try, which will turn off the screensaver:
<tscreen><verb>
$ xset s off
</verb></tscreen>
You may also combine the command to turn off DPMS and the screensaver:
<tscreen><verb>
$ xset -dpms s off
</verb></tscreen>
Finally, depending on your distribution, you may be able to turn it off from
within the control panel.
<sect1>Miscellaneous
<sect2>mythfilldatabase failing
<p>If mythfilldatabase suddenly appears to be failing, there are at least
two things to check.  

First, if you are in North America, ensure that your DataDirect subscription
is still valid, otherwise, check to see what version of XMLTV you're
running and that it's the latest version.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">

<sect2>Fast CPU, choppy or jittery video <label id="Setting_DMA">
<p>First, you should check that your kernel has been enabled for DMA:
<tscreen><verb>
[mythtv@pvr mythtv]$ dmesg |grep DMA
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd800-0xd807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd808-0xd80f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hda: 156301488 sectors (80026 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=9729/255/63, UDMA(33)
hdb: 80043264 sectors (40982 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=4982/255/63, UDMA(33)
</verb></tscreen>

From the listing above, you can see that hda, hdb and hdc are set for DMA,
and hdd is set for pio.  If your kernel is not reporting DMA being enabled,
you may need to recompile your kernel. Check your motherboard's chipset
(look in the "ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support" section in "make menuconfig") for more
information.

Next, check that the hard drive has DMA enabled.  Use the <bf>hdparm</bf>
program to check and enable DMA.
<tscreen><verb>
# hdparm -d /dev/hd?
</verb></tscreen> will tell you the DMA status for your hard drives.  If you run
<bf>hdparm</bf> with the <tt>-d1</tt> parameter, it will turn DMA on.

<!-- Next section adopted from a post by Dwaine Garden
dwainegarden@rogers.com to the mailing list. -->

You may also setup your PC to do this at boot time, either by adding the
command to your <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt> file, or by adding files to
/etc/sysconfig.

On Mandrake and other distributions, if you install <bf>hdparm</bf> from an RPM you
will most likely get a <tt>/etc/sysconfig/harddisks</tt> file installed. 
This file will be parsed by the <tt>/etc/rc.sysinit</tt> script.  If you use
the default <tt>harddisks</tt> file, your changes will affect all IDE devices
(including CD ROMs).  If you wish to use different parameters for various
devices, rename and/or copy the file to <tt>harddiskhda</tt>,
<tt>harddiskhdb</tt>, etc.  Edit the file to your liking and on the next
reboot your setting will be preserved.

Audio appears to be one of the bigger issues that users run into on the
mailing list.  If the audio isn't configured correctly, then MythTV will
often appear to hang, when in fact it is trying to manipulate the audio
subsystem and failing.  You may or may not receive error messages indicating
that the source of the error is the audio subsystem.

You can not use <bf>xawtv</bf> to determine if your audio is working
correctly, since <bf>xawtv</bf> is simply using the analog sound patched
through line-in to line-out. It doesn't need to digitize the sound unless
you are using the recording function.

A better test to verify that sound will work for MythTV (and recording with
<bf>xawtv</bf> for that matter) is to startup <bf>xawtv</bf>, mute the
line-in then run <tt>aplay /dev/dsp</tt>. You should hear the recorded audio
slightly delayed behind the real-time video. You should see messages about
"underrun". These can be ignored but they do confirm that the driver is
loaded and there is an active device. Once this test succeeds, MythTV
should work correctly because it writes to and read from /dev/dsp in
the same way that <bf>aplay</bf> does.

To record audio along with video the audio signal must be digitized by a DSP
so that the audio data can be stored in a file. On playback, the audio data
is written to /dev/dsp and converted back to an analog signal. This analog
signal should then be sent to your speakers. Here is what is needed in
<bf>alsamixer</bf>. If you are using an ALSA version after 1.0.6, use
<bf>alsamixer -V all</bf>:

CAPTUR source - the analog source to be sent to the DSP. This should be set
to the input source from the tuner card to the sound card. In most cases
this is Line but this could also be Aux, CD, Mic, etc., depending on how you
connect the input cable. This source should be muted to prevent patching
through the analog sound. The volume of this source will not affect the
record level.

Capture mixer - this sets the level for the analog to digital recording.
While a volume of 100% is recommended for testing, distortion may occur.
Lowering this level to 75% to 85% may result in better audio quality.
"Capture" should be marked as the CAPTUR destination.

PCM mixer - this sets the level for the digital to analog playback. While a
volume of 100% is recommended for testing, distortion may occur. Lowering
this level to 75% to 85% may result in better audio quality.

Master mixer - sets the level for the analog signal sent to line-out or the
speakers.

You may also want to ensure that <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> , or whatever device
file is being used, hasn't already been grabbed by another process, like
<bf>esd</bf> or <bf>artsd</bf>.  If the device file isn't available, then
MythTV won't work.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>: MythTV now has support for using
<bf>artsd</bf>.  This is a compile-time option, so you will need to edit the
<tt>settings.pro</tt> file in the mythtv directory then perform a <tt>make
distclean; make</tt>, and re-run <tt>make install</tt> as root to add this
support.  Otherwise, check your window manager documentation for
instructions on disabling the sound manager.

If you wish to see what application is grabbing a resource, you can use the
<tt>fuser</tt> command:
<tscreen><verb>
# fuser -v /dev/dsp

To disable aRts in KDE, go to KDE->Control Center->Sound->Sound System and
uncheck the "Start aRts soundserver on KDE startup" box.  Run <tt># killall
artsd</tt> from the command line to stop the artsd program.

If you're using multiple sound cards and multiple tuners, use <tt>alsamixer
-c 1</tt> to work with the second sound card.  The first card is #0, the
second card is #1, etc.

<sect2>The mythbackend program told me to look at this section
<p>mythbackend does a check to see if your sound device is capable of full
duplex operation.  If it's not, it's most likely that you're going to run
into issues when you try to record and play sound at the same time.  If your
backend is a separate machine than your frontend, then there's no problem,
since you're only going to be doing one thing at a time with the card. 
Likewise, if you're running the frontend and backend on the same machine,
but you're using btaudio or a Hauppauge PVR-250 as your recording source,
and using the playback function of your sound card, then you also shouldn't
have an issue, since the sound card isn't being asked to perform two
functions at once.

If you can't get your sound card to go full duplex and need it to, then check
your distribution for updated sound drivers.  If your sound card is not
capable of full-duplex operation, either because the drivers don't support
it, or it has been designed that way, then you're pretty much out of luck
and will either need to purchase a new sound card, or will need to get
btaudio <ref id="btaudio" name="operational">.

<sect2>My remote doesn't work / works sometimes and not others / "ghost" keypresses
<p>This can be due to a number of factors.  The simplest case is the
"ghost" keypresses.  For me, it was due to compact fluorescent lights in
the same room as the IR receiver, which the receiver was picking up as
keypresses.  Once the lights were switched to incandescent bulbs, the ghost
went away.

You may have an issue with <bf>lirc</bf> misinterpreting IR commands from a
different remote.  I also have an issue where the TiVo "Peanut" remote will
eventually cause <bf>lircd</bf> to stop responding; even though <bf>lircd</bf>
is configured for the Pinnacle Systems remote, the TiVo remote IR patterns
are being seen by the IR receiver.

If your remote has been properly configured, and <bf>irw</bf> and
<bf>irxevent</bf> are working correctly, then it's highly likely that your
window manager is not giving focus correctly to the various Myth programs as
they run.  The following window managers are known to work correctly:

<itemize>
<item>fvwm
<item>blackbox  (using "Sloppy Focus" and "Focus New Windows")
</itemize>

<bf>NOTE</bf>:  You do not need to use <bf>irxevent</bf> if you are using
MythTV's native LIRC support, so the window manager focus issue does not
apply in that case.

<sect2>Mythweb is showing a db_open error when I connect to it
<!-- Fix by Chris Ripp [chris@ripp.net] post to mailing list -->
<p>Find your <tt>php.ini</tt> file. Make sure you've got a line in it like this:

<tt>extension=mysql.so</tt>

Restart <bf>apache</bf> for it to take effect.

<sect2>Mouse pointer disappears when placed over the MythTV windows
<p>This is the intended behavior.  The MythTV interface is meant for use
with a remote control or a keyboard.

<sect2>What does "strange error flushing buffer" mean on the console?
<p>Nothing, really.  It's just lame (the mp3 encoder) complaining for some
obscure reason.  This seems to be fixed in more recent versions of the
libmp3lame library.

<sect2>Can't change the channel when watching Live TV.
<p>Something's wrong with your program database.  Did mythfilldatabase run
with no major errors?  Or, MythTV may not have permissions to the
appropriate video4linux devices.  See the section titled <ref id="devperms"
name="Device Permissions"> for an example.

<sect2>Troubleshooting the Hauppauge PVR-250 IR remote
<p>The most likely issue is that you have incompatible versions of the
<bf>lirc_i2c</bf> and <bf>lirc_dev</bf> modules and the various
<bf>lircd</bf> programs.  See the section called <ref id="hauppauge_remote"
name="Hauppauge PVR-250 remote and MythTV's native LIRC support."> for
examples on finding and removing old versions of lirc.

<sect2>Screen goes black when you try to play something
<p>MythTV prints error and status messages to the shell that was used to
start the application.  If nothing seems to be happening when you try to
view a program, try switching back to the shell and look for error messages
there, or, if you're running from a startup script, check the log file.

<sect2>Poor performance with NVidia cards and XvMC
<p>XvMC is a NVidia driver feature which is supposed to help with decoding
video.  Users have reported that rather than speeding up their video it
appears to be doing the opposite.  You may want to check that your color
depth is set for 24bpp.

<sect2>Computer is loading a media player application when you insert a CD or DVD
<p>You need to disable any sort of auto-running media player in your

<sect>Miscellaneous. 
<sect1>I'd like to watch the files without using MythTV / I'd like to convert the files to some other format
<p>MythTV comes with a utility called <bf>mythtranscode</bf> which can
decode nuv files into raw format for use with other applications.  This
command-line utility was not designed to be used by the end-user, but
instead to be called by other applications or scripts.  Programs like
<bf>mkmovie</bf> (<url url="http://www.icelus.org/"
name="http://www.icelus.org/">) and <bf>nuvexport</bf> (<url
url="http://forevermore.net/myth/" name="http://forevermore.net/myth/">) are
better suited for the end user.  However, since <bf>mythtranscode</bf> can
be a useful tool, directions on using it follow.

<bf>mythtranscode</bf> creates raw streams, which means that they do not
contain any container information such as resolution, frame-rate, or audio
sampling rate.  In order to process the output, you must supply this
information to the processing utility.  <bf>mythtranscode</bf> provides the
relevant information on STDOUT.

There are two modes in which <bf>mythtranscode</bf> can create raw streams. 
The first has no synchronization and assumes that the processing utility
will read audio and video at a constant rate.  This method is useful when a
single application will be processing the raw output, such as
<bf>mencoder</bf> or <bf>ffmpeg</bf>.  The second method assumes that two
separate applications will be processing the audio and video streams
independently, and there is no rate control between them which means that
the two programs don't coordinate their efforts to maintain synchronization.

<sect2>mythtranscode example
<p>First, start <bf>mythtranscode</bf>.  You will need to determine the
channel and the start time manually.
<tscreen><verb>
$ mythtranscode --chanid 1036 --starttime 2003-10-20T15:30:00 --profile \
autodetect --fifodir . &
</verb></tscreen>

When <bf>mythtranscode</bf> begins executing, it will create two FIFOs
("audout" and "vidout") in the directory specified (in this case ".",
meaning the current directory) and will print out information about the
video stream.

The next step is to start the processing application.  The following assumes
that the stream is NTSC 640x480 with 32Kbps audio.

To use <bf>mencoder</bf> you would enter a command like:
<tscreen><verb>
mencoder -audiofile audout -audio-demuxer 20 -rawaudio rate=32000 \
-rawvideo on:w=640:h=480:fps=29.97 -ovc lavc -oac mp3lame -o out.avi \
vidout
</verb></tscreen>

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>: You must use mencoder 1.0PRE1 or later. <bf>mencoder</bf>
version 0.9x <em>WILL NOT WORK!</em>
</caption>
</figure>
Using ffmepg:
<tscreen><verb>
ffmpeg -f u16le -ar 32000 -ac 2 -i audout -f rawvideo -s 640x480 -r 29.97 \
-i vidout -vcodec mpeg4 -b 2000 -acodec mp3 -ab 128 out.avi
</verb></tscreen>

Or to play directly using mplayer (again 1.0PRE1 or later is needed):
<tscreen><verb>
mplayer -audiofile audout -audio-demuxer 20 -rawaudio rate=32000 \
-rawvideo on:w=640:h=480:fps=29.97 vidout
</verb></tscreen>

If you wanted to write the raw data to separate audio and video files for
later processing, the following would work (note the use of --fifosync
for rate-control):
<tscreen><verb>
$ mythtranscode --chanid 1036 --starttime 2003-10-20T15:30:00 \
--profile autodetect --fifodir . --fifosync &
$ cat audout > audio.raw &
$ cat vidout > video.yuv
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Using a different window manager
<p>MythTV is not dependent on any particular window manager.  If you wish to
run a lightweight window manager, the <tt>configfiles/</tt> directory has an
example of a <tt>.twmrc</tt> and <tt>.fvwmrc</tt> file you may use.

<sect1>What capture resolution should I use?  How does video work?
<label id="capture_resolution_">
<!-- Lots of the following is from a Bruce Markey mailto:bjm@lvcm.com post
to the mailing list, 2003-01-21. Updated 2005-02-09 bjm  -->
<p>While MythTV allows you to set various GUI and capture resolutions, not
all combinations make sense.

First, analog video signals have a defined vertical resolution.  In NTSC,
the video standard specifies that there are 525 vertical scan lines.  Once
the "extra" lines are removed (they're used to synchronize the video signal,
and encode closed captioning data), you have 480 horizontal lines stacked
vertically.

In PAL, there are 625 "raw" lines of resolution, with a net of 576
horizontal lines stacked vertically.

Horizontally, the maximum value allowed for a Bt8X8 chip is 720. However,
due to limitations in the chip and other limitations of broadcast
television, there may not be a noticeable improvement in image quality
beyond 400 or 500 pixels.

With this in mind, there are certain commonly accepted values for
resolution.  While other values may be accepted for the vertical
resolution, they will cause scan lines to be repeated or dropped.

From "best" to "worst", in NTSC:
<itemize>
<item>720x480 ("DVD" resolution. Also commonly, 704x480)
<item>640x480 4:3
<item>544x480 (TiVo high resolution)
<item>480x480 (Video CD resolution)
<item>352x480 (ReplayTV "Standard" quality)
<item>320x480 
<item>544x240
<item>480x240 
<item>352x240 
<item>320x240
</itemize>

As you can see, the lower quality values are half of the better ones. 
720x240 is possible, but isn't a good tradeoff relative to the number of
vertical lines lost.  In a PAL country, the you would use values like
720x576 or x288.

The higher resolutions will be more CPU intensive if you're using software
encoding (PVR-250/350 will have minimal host CPU impact even if you're using
720x480). If the CPU is overtaxed, frames will be dropped causing uneven
motion. You will likely see the best results at resolutions which average at
least 10% CPU idle time.  You can use system tools such as <tt>top</tt> or
<tt>sar</tt> to check the CPU % idle while recording.  If the CPU average
usage is consistently exceeding 90%, frames will need to be dropped during
peak times when more than 100% of the available CPU would be needed to
process all of the frames.

<sect1>MythTV GUI and X Display Sizes
<p>MythTV is designed to be run as dedicated full screen TV application
but can also be run as a desktop application on a computer monitor. Here
are a few consideration for configuring sizes to best suit you needs.

<sect2>X Dimensions
<p>For output to a Television, common resolutions are 640x480, 800x600, and
some rare devices support 1024x768. Generally, higher resolutions are
better. However, you may find that you prefer the picture quality at one of
the lower resolutions. Everything in MythTV is scalable and should 'fit'
regardless of the resolution you choose.

Edit your X configuration file, usually "XF86Config-4", so that the
resolution you want to use is listed first in the lists under "Screen". If
this resolution is higher than the resolutions supported by your output
device, you will see a 'panning' effect where moving the mouse to the edge
will scroll around a desktop area which is larger than the display size. If
this happens, edit your X configuration file to match the display size then
restart X.

<sect2>MythTV Dimensions
<p>In 0.10 and later, from "mythfrontend" go to Setup->Appearance.
The default for the height and width is "0" - this will cause
MythTV to automatically size itself to full screen.

If the MythTV GUI width and height are not 0, mythfrontend uses these GUI
dimensions and is anchored to the upper left corner of the X Desktop. If
the GUI X and/or Y are not 0, the upper left corner is positioned at the
specified coordinates. If the "Run the frontend in a window" box is checked,
the window will have a frame and can then be dragged to any position on the
desktop.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>: When the GUI is full screen, you may see windows rapidly
flipping on top of each other. If this happens you will need to set your
window manager to 'Click to Focus' for windows to stack properly.
</caption>
</figure>
The fonts for the GUI and OSD will scale to whatever sizes you use. Most
font sizes can be changed in setup selections or in the .xml files under
<tt>/usr/local/share/mythtv/</tt> . Make sure to use fonts large enough
to be read on a TV screen from a distance.

The full screen TV size is based on the X display size. For Xinerama, you
can specify a screen in Setup->General. The TV picture will be stretched
to fit the entire GUI area regardless of the <ref id="capture_resolution_"
name="capture resolutions"> used. However, during playback, the "W" key can
to used to correct differences between 16:9 and 4:3.

<sect2>Overscan Dimensions
<p>Because picture edges can be ragged and screen edges aren't straight,
Television is designed to project an image larger than the physical screen.
This is called "overscan". Underscan is fitting the entire image inside the
screen. Underscan is useful for computer monitors so that toolbars and
scrollbars at the edges can be seen.

For best results, match the X display area as close as possible to the edges
of the physical screen. This can only be adjusted by your tv-out device or
by the settings for the television set. Many sets have these adjustments in
a 'service mode'. If you cannot make these adjustments, there will be black
borders around the edges of the X desktop, MythTV GUI and TV playback.

MythTV has settings for "Overscan" in Setup->Playback. These can not, and do
not, cause the image to display beyond the edge of the X display area. The
purpose of these settings are to cut off rough edges and to expand the image
so that objects will appear to be the same size as a normal overscanned TV
picture.

<sect1>Saving or restoring the database <label id="backupdb">

<sect1>btaudio <label id="btaudio">
<p>btaudio allows you to obtain the audio data from your tuner card directly
over the PCI bus without using a sound card.  This is useful if you would
like to use multiple tuner cards in a system without adding a sound card for
each one, or if your existing sound card is not capable of full-duplex
operation.

In order to use btaudio, your tuner card will need certain hardware
installed on it, and that hardware must be wired correctly.  The chip that
will allow you to use the btaudio module is the MSP34xx.  However, having a
MSP34xx is no guarantee that you will be able to use the btaudio module.

As of 2003-03-31, this is the current list of cards and their status:
Works with btaudio:

<itemize>
<item>Hauppauge WinTV-radio with dbx-TV stereo, model 401
<item>Hauppauge WinTV-Theater, model 495, 498 (Europe)
<item>ATI TV Wonder
</itemize>

The following cards do not work:
<itemize>
<item>Pinnacle Studio PCTV Pro - note: this has a MSP34xx, but it's not
wired correctly to the BT878 chip.
<item>ATI TV Wonder VE
<item>Leadtek Winfast 2000 XP (PAL, UK and NTSC)
<item>I/O Magic PC-PVR.  No MSP34xx chip.
</itemize>

The following cards have been reported to work, but have issues:
<itemize>
<item>Avermedia AVerTV Studio (no digital DSP output, "whiney noise" on
analog)
</itemize>

Once btaudio loads, it should register additional <tt>/dev/dsp</tt> and
<tt>/dev/mixer</tt> devices.  Typing <tt>$ dmesg</tt> will let you know
what's going on.

<sect1>Removing unwanted channels
<p>If <bf>mythfilldatabase</bf> grabbed a channel which you do not want to
include in your TV listings, you can remove the entries from the grabber
configuration and the MySQL database.  This often happens with premium
channels; for example, HBO or Showtime may be available on your cable TV
system, but is scrambled because you're not a subscriber to that channel. 
Since you can never watch it, you want to get rid of it.

If you are using the DataDirect service, login to your account at
<url url="http://labs.zap2it.com/" name="http://labs.zap2it.com/"> to
modify your lineup. Uncheck the boxes for any unwanted channels, and they
will no longer be included in your download.

If you are using a grabber from XMLTV, comment out the channel from the
<tt>~/.mythtv/&lt;sourcename&gt;.xmltv</tt> file by inserting the word "not
" (including the space) in front of the unwanted entry. This will prevent
<bf>xmltv</bf> from grabbing future listings.

Next, delete the unwanted item from the channel table so that it will not
appear in the EPG or when changing channels.  To delete the data from the
database we need to perform some steps.  First, assuming that HBO is channel
15, we need to find out the internal <tt>chanid</tt> used by MySQL:
<tscreen><verb>
$ mysql -u root mythconverg
mysql> select chanid from channel where channum=15;
+--------+
| chanid |
+--------+
|   1015 |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
mysql> delete from channel where chanid = 1015;
</verb></tscreen>

Old program data will be removed over the course of a week. However, you may
want to immediately delete any current program listings for the channel that
has been removed:
<tscreen><verb>
$ mysql -u root mythconverg
mysql> delete from program where chanid = 1015;
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>NFS
<p>You may want to use a central server to store your files.  

On the host machine, (in this case, the hostname is "masterbackend") you'll
want to edit your <tt>/etc/exports</tt> file and use something like:
<tscreen><verb>
/var/video (rw)
</verb></tscreen>

To export the <tt>/var/video</tt> directory with read / write privileges.

On the "slave" machine, you'll want to edit the <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> file and
add something like:
<tscreen><verb>
masterbackend:/var/video /var/video nfs rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,nfsvers=3
</verb></tscreen>

Then run <tt># fstab -a</tt> to re-read the file to mount the file system.

In this case, the source is a machine called "masterbackend" which is
exporting the directory "/var/video", which we're mounting locally at
"/var/video".  The rsize and wsize options are used to increase the
performance of NFS; "hard,intr" is there because that's the recommendation
of the NFS-HOWTO, and the nfsvers is required for filesizes over 2GB.

<sect1>Automatically starting mythfrontend at system boot time
<p>Here's an example submitted to the mythtv-dev list by Pat Pflaum

<sect1>Automatically starting mythbackend at system boot time
<sect2>Red Hat And Mandrake
<p>Here's a method for automatically starting mythbackend submitted by Mike
Thomson (<url url="mailto:linux@m-thomson.net" name="mailto:linux@m-thomson.net">) and Stu Tomlinson (<url
url="mailto:stu@nosnilmot.com" name="mailto:stu@nosnilmot.com">).

Copy the files from the MythTV <tt>contrib</tt> directory or from Mike's web
site (<url url="http://m-thomson.net/mythtv/"
name="http://m-thomson.net/mythtv/">) as follows:

<tt>etc.rc.d.init.mythbackend</tt> should be made executable and copied to
<tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
$ cd contrib
$ su
# chmod a+x etc.rc.d.init.d.mythbackend
# cp etc.rc.d.init.d.mythbackend /etc/rc.d/init.d/mythbackend
</verb></tscreen>

<tt>etc.sysconfig.mythbackend</tt> should be copied to
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
$ cd contrib
$ su
# cp etc.sysconfig.mythbackend /etc/sysconfig/mythbackend
</verb></tscreen>

Edit <tt>/etc/sysconfig/mythbackend</tt> if you want to change the defaults
(the userid that should start mythbackend, location of the logfile and (if
required) the name and location of the mythbackend binary).

Use <bf>chkconfig</bf> to make sure the script is called when
entering runlevels 3, 4 or 5:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# chkconfig --level 345 mythbackend on
# exit
$
</verb></tscreen>

<sect3>Log files 
<p>By default, the log file for mythbackend will be written to
<tt>/var/tmp/mythbackend.log</tt>. This has been tested and is known to work
on Mandrake and Red Hat, but many people prefer to place logs under
<tt>/var/log/</tt>.

To do this, create a group called <tt>mythtv</tt> (or anything you prefer)
and add your usual MythTV users to that group. If you changed the user that
starts mythbackend from the default of root you <em>must</em> perform this
step.

Create the directory <tt>/var/log/mythtv</tt> and set its
permissions as follows:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# mkdir /var/log/mythtv
# chown root:mythtv /var/log/mythtv
# chmod 0775 /var/log/mythtv
# exit
$ ls -ld /var/log/mythtv
drwxrwxr-x    2 root     mythtv       4096 Apr 28 21:58 /var/log/mythtv/
$
</verb></tscreen>

<sect3>Mandrake 9.x
<p>Mandrake adds one more twist in the form of the <tt>msec</tt> utility,
which runs regularly and (at the default or any higher security level) sets
permissions on many files, including those under <tt>/var/log</tt>.

To tell msec about the MythTV log files and their directory, you need to
edit the <tt>/etc/security/msec/perm.local</tt> file to include the
following:
<tscreen><verb>
# /etc/security/msec/perm.local
# Local overrides to the msec program
#
# Full file path                user.group              permissions
/var/log/mythtv/                root.mythtv             775
/var/log/mythtv/*               root.mythtv             664
</verb></tscreen>

A copy of the above has been included in the contrib/ directory.  You may
add it by typing:
<tscreen><verb>
$ cd contrib

<sect1>Advanced Backend Configurations <label id="advanced_backend_config">
<p>MythTV is flexible in the way that you define multiple backend tuner
configurations.  The only hard-and-fast rule is that the Master backend
<em>must</em> have a capture device defined, but shouldn't imply that the
capture device in the Master backend must be the first capture card defined in the
database.

One example of an advanced configuration is the round-robin scheme.  Rather
than defining all of the cards on the master, you could first go into setup
on the master to define globals such as the general configuration and the
channel lineup but not the host-specific configuration item like the capture
card.  In this example, we will use a 4 tuner configuration, where two
slaves have one card each and the master has two.
<enum>
<item>Add the first capture card on one of the slaves.  Complete the
configuration, connecting the input source to the card.  This will get
cardid #1 in the database.  Exit setup.
<item>Configure the first capture card on the master backend.  This will get
cardid #2 in the database.  Exit setup.
<item>Configure the first capture card on the second slave.  This will be
cardid #3 in the database.  Exit setup.
<item>Configure the second capture card on the master backend.  This will
get cardid #4 in the database.  Exit setup.
</enum>

Using this scheme, the master backend will not use both capture cards until
one of the following happens:
<itemize>
<item>There are four recordings scheduled for the same time
<item>Both slaves are not available
</itemize>

The scheduler in MythTV checks whether an encoder is available; if a slave
backend isn't running, its encoder isn't available, so the scheduler will
look for the next available encoder.  This makes MythTV very flexible; slave
tuners can come and go, and as long as there are enough tuners for what
you'd like to record it doesn't matter which tuner in particular is going to
be used.

Using this round-robin scheme along with a shared storage directory like
NFS and enabling the Master Backend Override setting will allow you to view
content even if the slave backend that recorded a program is not available.

<sect1>What is this transcoder thing, and how do I use it?
<p>The transcoder re-encodes files from one MythTV format to another.  The
main purpose of the transcoder is to allow users with hardware
encoders (PVR-250) or systems that can only record in RTjpeg due to
performance reasons (multiple capture cards, slow system, etc) to create
MPEG-4 streams to save space.

The transcoder can be used in two ways:
<itemize>
<item>Automatically re-encode every file once it has completed recording
<item> After marking commercials, the transcoder can be run manually to
delete the commercials from the file (thus further saving space)
</itemize>
The two methods are independent.  The first is an automatic process that can be
enabled/disabled through the setup program; the second is a manual method which
must be invoked on each recording individually.

The second method can be used on files that have already been transcoded (or
files which were are already in the correct format), so only the frames
immediately following a cut section will be re-encoded, resulting in a very
minimal loss of quality.

To enable automatic transcoding, do the following:
   start the setup program
   under the host-specific settings:
      set the Transcoder Auto-run checkbox

For either manual or automatic transcoding:
   start mythbackend
   start mythfrontend
   select setup, and the Transcoding recording profile.
      now select either RTjpeg or MPEG-4 (selecting any of the hardware
      encoders will result in the transcoder not working).
      set the other parameters as you'd like.  For best performance, you
      should match the audio to the 'Default' profile.  If you plan to
      only use the manual transcoder, you can choose to set the video to
      be the same as the default profile too (as long as it is MPEG-4 or
      RTjpeg)

Everything should now be setup properly.  If you elected to use the
Auto-Run feature, the transcoder will automatically launch after each
recording is complete.  The transcoder thread runs at a low priority, so it
should not impact any critical tasks or other recordings.

If you want to manually transcode a program, simply press 'X' while
watching a recording (you should have already finished marking all
commercials).  If you change your mind, hitting 'X' again will stop the
transcoding.

Once the transcode is complete, mythbackend will replace the old file
with the new as soon as it is no longer in use.

<sect1>Changing your hostname
<!-- Edited instructions from a post by Alan Snyder ax763 at yahoo.com -->
<p>If you need to change the name of the computers used with MythTV you'll
need to perform a sequence of steps.  There are a number of pieces of
information that MythTV keeps track of which are tied to the hostname of the
box, so changing the hostname involves altering the name in the
operating system and in the MySQL database.  In the examples below, the old
name of the system was "frontend1" and we're going to change it to
"kidsroom".

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  Changing the hostname using direct SQL update commands will
break things.  You <em>MUST</em> use this indirect method.
</caption>
</figure> 

1.  Stop all backends.  If you run <bf>mythbackend</bf> from a terminal
session, press control-c. If your backends are started with an init
script, you would do something like the following:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# /etc/init.d/mythbackend stop
</verb></tscreen>

2.  Change the hostname.

For Red Hat and derived distributions, edit the
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/network</tt> file.  Look for
<tt>HOSTNAME=frontend1</tt> and change this to
<tt>HOSTNAME=kidsroom</tt> or whatever you'll be using.  For other
distributions, refer to the documentation, such as the
<verb>hostname(1)</verb> man page.

<p>
To alter the
hostname in the current session, run:
<tscreen><verb>
# hostname kidsroom
</verb></tscreen>

3.  Dump the database.
<tscreen><verb>
$ mysqldump -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg -c > mythtv_backup.sql
</verb></tscreen>

4.  Rename the host in the database.  First, ensure that the new hostname
you'll be using isn't already in the database.
<tscreen><verb>
$ grep kidsroom mythtv_backup.sql
</verb></tscreen>
Now we're actually going to change the name.  The following should all be
typed on the same line:
<tscreen><verb>
$ cat mythtv_backup.sql | sed s/\'frontend1\'/\'kidsroom\'/ >> mythtv_restore.sql
</verb></tscreen>
If you don't feel comfortable using <bf>sed</bf>, you can open the
<tt>mythtv_backup.sql</tt> file in a text editor and perform a global search
and replace.  When saving the file, make sure you use the new name,
<tt>mythtv_restore.sql</tt> or the rest of the steps below will fail.
	
5.  Drop and recreate the database.
<tscreen><verb>
$ mysql -u root
mysql>drop database mythconverg;
mysql>create database mythconverg;
mysql>exit	
</verb></tscreen>

6.  Restore the database using your edited version.
<tscreen><verb>
$ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg < mythtv_restore.sql
</verb></tscreen>

If you are running slave backends or frontends, don't forget to re-enable
access as detailed in <ref id="modify_perm_mysql" name="Modifying access to
the MySQL database for multiple systems">. 

7.  Start the backends.  If you use init scripts, do the following, otherwise
start them from terminal consoles.
<tscreen><verb>
# /etc/init.d/mythbackend start
</verb></tscreen>

8.  Quit and restart all frontends.  Delete the <tt>mythtv_backup.sql</tt>
and <tt>mythtv_restore.sql</tt> files.

<sect1>Can I run MythTV on my TiVo?
<sect1>Can I run MythTV on my ReplayTV?
<p>No.

While it is true that the TiVo runs the Linux kernel, and TiVo has released
their changes to the kernel under the GPL, the TiVo is <em>not</em> a
general-purpose computer, and there is no programming information available
for the custom hardware contained within a TiVo.  TiVo is under no
obligation to release the source code to their <em>application</em>.

The ReplayTV runs VxWorks, a Real Time Operating System from Wind River
Systems.
<sect1>Can a wireless connection be used between the frontend and the backend?
<p>Yes, assuming that your wireless connection has sufficient bandwidth to
maintain the datarate between the frontend and the backend.  802.11b should
be sufficient if the encoded bitrate of the content is less than the
datarate of your wireless connection, which in the case of 802.11b would be
approximately 4 Mbps.  (The advertised rate of 11Mbps gives an actual
throughput of 4 Mbps.) 802.11a and 802.11g, if operating in their high-speed
modes, or proprietary 802.11b "Turbo" schemes should be adequate.  Multiple
wireless frontends, poor signal strength or other factors can severely
impact the viewing experience on the frontend.

<sect1>How can I burn shows that I have recorded to a DVD?
<p>There are two answers to this question.  The easiest thing to do is to
simply burn the MythTV files onto the DVD and treat the DVD as if it were a
hard drive.  This will allow you to save the programs, but it's likely that
they will <em>not</em> be playable in a DVD player because the disc will
simply contain files and not any DVD structure.  If you'd like to create a
DVD that will play in a standard DVD player and your files have been
recorded as MPEG-2 from a device supported by the IVTV driver, the first
step you'll need to perform is to remux the file to make it DVD compliant. 
Next, you'll use <bf>dvdauthor</bf>, <bf>mkisofs</bf> to create the ISO
image, and finally <bf>dvdrecord</bf> to burn that to a blank DVD-R.

The requirements for this procedure are <bf>mjpegtools</bf> (provides
<bf>mplex</bf>) and <bf>dvdauthor</bf> (provides <bf>mpeg2desc</bf> and
<bf>dvdauthor</bf>).

This script will perform the necessary steps. You'll need to pass it the
.nuv file and a name for the new DVD project.  You should end up with a
directory which you can <bf>mkisofs</bf> into a ISO file then burn it.

<tscreen><verb>
#!/bin/sh

mkfifo aud0
mkfifo vid0
mkfifo dvdmpg

mpeg2desc -a0 < $1 > aud0 &
mpeg2desc -v0 < $1 > vid0 &
mplex -f 8 -V -o dvdmpg aud0 vid0 &
dvdauthor -o $2 -f dvdmpg
dvdauthor -o $2 -T

rm aud0
rm vid0
rm dvdmpg
</verb></tscreen>

It's also possible to pipe the output of <bf>mkisofs</bf> directly to
<bf>cdrecord</bf> without any intermediate files being written to your hard
drive.  For example:
<tscreen><verb>
#!/bin/sh
TSIZE=`mkisofs -dvd-video -udf -q -print-size .`
mkisofs -dvd-video -udf -V "$1" . | nice -10 cdrecord speed=1 dev=1,1,0 \
driveropts=burnfree -dao -v tsize="$TSIZE"s -
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Burning a MythTV recording to a DVD (alternate version)
<p>
<!-- by Jeff Couvrette.  See if this can be combined with existing
instructions? -->

This is specific to MPEG-2 .nuv files created by Hauppauge PVR-X50 video 
capture cards.

The software packages you will want are:
<itemize>
<item>dvd+rw-tools
<item>dvdauthor
<item>mjpegtools
<item>avidemux2
<item>transcode - not necessary for this, but useful for working with video
<item>k3b - a gui for burning DVD's and CD's.  Not necessary, but useful.
</itemize>

1. Find the file you want.

2. Run <bf>avidemux2</bf> and open the .nuv file which corresponds with the
program you wish to burn to DVD.

3. Remove the segments you don't need.  Click twice on "A" when you are at
the beginning of the segment you want to save, find the end of the segment,
and click "B".

4. Save the raw video stream and audio: <tt>File-> Save -> Save Raw Video
Stream</tt>.  Save the file as <tt>1.m2v</tt>.  When that's done, go to
<tt>Audio -> Save Audio</tt>.  Save the file as <tt>1.mp2</tt>

5. Repeat steps 2 & 3 until you have saved all the segments you wish to keep.

6.  Mplex the video and audio for each segment together in DVD-MPEG2 format.
Do that by running

<tt>mplex -f 8 -o 1.mpg 1.m2v 1.mp2</tt>

7.  Create a DVD file system by running

<tt>dvdauthor -o DVD 1.mpg 2.mpg ... n.mpg</tt>

<tt>dvdauthor -T -o DVD</tt>

8.  Put a blank DVD in your drive and write the video by running

<tt>growisofs -Z /dev/scd0 -dvd-video DVD</tt>

9.  Be sure and check the DVD in a player and then delete all the files you 
created in this process.

Notes:

You can reduce the size of your files and fit more video on a DVD by using 
<bf>tcrequant</bf>, which is part of <bf>transcode</bf>.  

The steps above create a DVD that starts playing the video automatically. If
you want to burn a DVD with menus and multiple video titles, see the next
section.

<sect1>Creating a DVD with Menus
<p>
This assumes that you have already formatted the videos in a 
DVD-compliant format that works with <bf>dvdauthor</bf>. 

<sect2>CREATING A MENU
<p>
This is potentially the most difficult step in creating a DVD with a menu.
You must capture or create a background image with the appropriate
resolution and <bf>mplex</bf> it together with an audio file (typically
silence, although though you may use sound) and then create overlay images
that show

<enum>
<item>the menu text
<item>the highlighted buttons
<item>the selected buttons  
</enum>

You would then use <bf>spumux</bf> to combine the background video with the
overlay menus.

The background image must be saved as a JPG and the overlay images must be
PNG with a maximum of three colors.  Four colors are allowed, but the
transparent background counts as one of the available colors.  In these
examples, the background file is called <tt>menu.jpg</tt>, the menu text is called
<tt>menu1.png</tt> and the highlighted and selected buttons are the same and called
<tt>menu2.png</tt>.


<sect3>Create a Background 
<p>
To get a background image, use <bf>avidemux2</bf> and find the frame you
wish to use as a background image.  Save the frame as
<tt>menu.jpg</tt> by executing <tt>File -> Save -> Save JPG Image</tt>.  

You may also create your own background image in the GIMP.  Use the following
settings:

For NTSC Video:
<tscreen><verb>
width: 720
height: 480
x-axis: 81dpi
y-axis: 72dpi
</verb></tscreen>

<sect3>Convert the background JPG file into a M2V video file
<p>
<tt>jpeg2yuv -n 50 -I p -f 29.97 -j menu.jpg | mpeg2enc -n n -f 8 -o menu.m2v</tt>

For PAL Video 
<tscreen><verb>
width: 720
height: 576
x-axis: 75dpi
y-axis: 80dpi
</verb></tscreen>

<sect3>Convert the background JPG file into a M2V video file
<p>
<tt>jpeg2yuv -n 50 -I p -f 25 -j menu.jpg | mpeg2enc -n p -f 8 -o 
menu.m2v</tt>

<sect3>Merge the background you just created with audio 
<p>
You will need some sort of audio to <bf>mplex</bf> with the M2V file you
just created, so either capture some audio using <bf>avidemux2</bf> or
another program, or to create empty audio to <bf>mplex</bf>, use this
command

<tt>dd if=/dev/zero bs=4 count=2000 | toolame -b 128 -s 48 /dev/stdin 
menu.mp2</tt>

<sect3>Merge the M2V video with the MP2 audio
<p>
<tt>mplex -f 8 -o menu.mpg menu.m2v menu.mp2</tt>

<sect3>Create the menu buttons
<p>

Open the background <tt>menu.jpg</tt> file in the GIMP.  Add a transparent layer
over the background and mark where you will want the different buttons to be
located.  This layer will later be deleted, so it doesn't have to be clean. 
When creating this layer, use all the colors you want to use in your
buttons.  Remember, no more than three colors.

Delete the Background layer.

Change the image to an indexed color mode.  Do this by right-clicking on
the image and selecting <tt>Image -> Mode -> Indexed</tt>.  Enter "4" in the
number of colors.

Create two new layers.

In the top layer, you will enter the text for your buttons.  Select the
color you want for your text either in the color palette or by using the
Color Picker Tool.  To use the Color Picker, you must make sure you have
that bottom layer selected.  Enter the text for all the buttons on the top
layer according to whatever layout you decided on.

Now you will create the actual buttons by drawing boxes around the text
and filling that area with the Color Fill Tool.  Be sure and select the
color you want (contrasting to the text) and to create your boxes in the
second from the top layer.

Delete that bottom layer which we stated earlier would be deleted.

Save the current image as <tt>menu2.png</tt>.  Do that by right-clicking
and selecting <tt>File -> Save as</tt>, and make the name <tt>menu.png</tt>. 
Click "Export" and make sure that "Save Background Color" and "Save
Resolution" are selected.

Select the bottom layer and change the Opacity to 0%.  Now save the image 
as <tt>menu1.png</tt>.

<sect3>Create the final menu video 

<p> To create the DVD menu, an XML file is used.  An example
<tt>menu.xml</tt> file is shown below.  The autoorder line is used to decide
what takes precident for ordering.  If your buttons are ordered primarily by
rows, then select "rows".  If your ordering is by column, then choose
"columns".

<tscreen><verb>
###begin menu.xml###
<subpictures>
  <stream>
    <spu
     force="yes"
     start="00:00:00.00"
     image="menu1.png"
     select="menu2.png"
     highlight="menu2.png"
     autooutline="infer"
     outlinewidth="6"
     autoorder="rows"
    >
    &lt;/spu>
  &lt;/stream>
&lt;/subpictures>
###end menu.xml###
</verb></tscreen>

Then create the final menu with

<tt>spumux menu.xml &lt; menu.mpg &gt; menu_final.mpg</tt>

You should see some lines in the output to the console that show

     INFO:  Autodetect ...

The number of these lines that you see should be the same number of buttons 
you created.  If there are, then good job!


<sect2>Authoring the DVD
<p>
To create the DVD structure, an XML file is used.  The below file is an
example <tt>dvd.xml</tt> file.  This example file allows for the 4 buttons in the
menu created earlier and has three video segments making up each of the 4
video titles.  Each of the separate video segments will be treated as
separate chapters of one consistent video title.

<tscreen><verb>
### begin dvd.xml ###
&lt;dvdauthor dest="DVD"&gt;
  &lt;vmgm&gt;
    &lt;menus&gt;
      &lt;pgc&gt;
        &lt;button&gt;jump title 1;&lt;/button&gt; 
        &lt;button&gt;jump title 2;&lt;/button&gt; 
        &lt;button&gt;jump title 3;&lt;/button&gt; 
        &lt;button&gt;jump title 4;&lt;/button&gt; 
        &lt;vob file="menu_final.mpg" pause="inf" /&gt; 
      &lt;/pgc&gt;
    &lt;/menus&gt;
  &lt;/vmgm&gt;
  &lt;titleset&gt;
    &lt;titles&gt;
      &lt;pgc&gt;
        &lt;post&gt;call vmgm menu 1;&lt;/post&gt; 
        &lt;vob file="1a.mpg" /&gt; 
        &lt;vob file="1b.mpg" /&gt; 
        &lt;vob file="1c.mpg" /&gt; 
      &lt;/pgc&gt;
    &lt;/titles&gt;
  &lt;/titleset&gt;
  &lt;titleset&gt;
    &lt;titles&gt;
      &lt;pgc&gt;
        &lt;post&gt;call vmgm menu 1;&lt;/post&gt; 
        &lt;vob file="2a.mpg" /&gt; 
        &lt;vob file="2b.mpg" /&gt; 
        &lt;vob file="2c.mpg" /&gt; 
      &lt;/pgc&gt;
    &lt;/titles&gt;
  &lt;/titleset&gt;
  &lt;titleset&gt;
    &lt;titles&gt;
      &lt;pgc&gt;
        &lt;post&gt;call vmgm menu 1;&lt;/post&gt; 
        &lt;vob file="3a.mpg" /&gt; 
        &lt;vob file="3b.mpg" /&gt; 
        &lt;vob file="3c.mpg" /&gt; 
      &lt;/pgc&gt;
    &lt;/titles&gt;
  &lt;/titleset&gt;
  &lt;titleset&gt;
    &lt;titles&gt;
      &lt;pgc&gt;
        &lt;post&gt;call vmgm menu 1;&lt;/post&gt; 
        &lt;vob file="4a.mpg" /&gt; 
        &lt;vob file="4b.mpg" /&gt; 
        &lt;vob file="4c.mpg" /&gt; 
      &lt;/pgc&gt;
    &lt;/titles&gt;
  &lt;/titleset&gt;
&lt;/dvdauthor&gt;
### end dvd.xml ###
</verb></tscreen>

Create the DVD file structure with

<tt>dvdauthor -x dvd.xml</tt>

Test the created DVD file structure with

<tt>xine dvd:/full/path/to/DVD/VIDEO_TS/</tt>

Then burn the DVD file structure to a DVD with

<tt>growisofs -Z /dev/scd0 -dvd-video DVD</tt>


<sect1>Migrating from XMLTV to DataDirect <label id="MigratingtoDD">
<!-- Mostly from a post by Bruce Markey -->
<p>DataDirect will use different information for your video sources and
channels than was used by XMLTV. The following will clear your old
information in a way that will allow your EPG and existing recording rules
to continue to work as you'd expect.

The first step is to create a backup of your database using the
instructions found in <ref id="backupdb" name="Saving or restoring
the database">

<bf>NOTE</bf>: Examine the contents of the backup file to be sure that the
backup succeeded before modifying your database.

<bf>NOTE</bf>: The MythTV DataDirect grabber requires <bf>wget</bf> version
1.9.1 or later. Verify that this is installed before modifying your
database.

Next, start <bf>mysql</bf> and perform the following commands:
<tscreen><verb>
$ mysql -u root mythconverg
mysql>CREATE TABLE channel_copy SELECT * FROM channel;
mysql>exit
$
</verb></tscreen>

Run the MythTV setup program.  When the setup program prompts "Would you
like to clear all program/channel settings before starting configuration
[no]" type "yes".

Complete the configuration as detailed in the section called <ref
id="ConfigureDD" name="Configuring the Zap2It.com DataDirect service"> and
in <ref id="VideoSources" name="Video Sources">.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption>
You <em>must</em> associate your DataDirect information with the inputs on
your capture device.  If you created "Cable-DD", then don't forget to bind
<tt>/dev/video0</tt> to Cable-DD in the <ref id="VideoSources" name="Video
Sources"> portion of setup.
</caption>
</figure>

Once you're done running setup, run <bf>mythfilldatabase</bf> to populate
the database with new data.

To restore the channel icons, you will need to perform one of two steps. 
Both are dependant on the channel_copy table you created above.

If you're running MySQL v3, execute the following.  Note that the
select command is very long.  You can press ENTER at the end of each line;
the command won't be evaluated until you end the statement with a semicolon.
<tscreen><verb>
$ mysql -u root mythconverg
mysql>create table channel_temp
select c.chanid, c.channum, c.sourceid, c.callsign, c.name, cb.icon,
c.finetune, c.videofilters, c.xmltvid, c.contrast, c.brightness,
c.colour, c.freqid, c.recpriority, c.hue, c.tvformat,
c.commfree, c.visible, c.outputfilters
from channel c
left join channel_copy cb on (c.callsign = cb.callsign);
mysql>truncate channel;
mysql>insert channel select * from channel_temp;
mysql>drop table channel_temp;
mysql>drop table channel_copy;
mysql>exit
$
</verb></tscreen>

If you are running MySQL v4, it's a little simpler. The next command is
one long string:
<tscreen><verb>
$ mysql -u root mythconverg
mysql>UPDATE channel,channel_copy SET channel.icon = channel_copy.icon 
WHERE channel.callsign = channel_copy.callsign;
mysql>drop table channel_copy;
mysql>exit
$
</verb></tscreen>
<sect1>What do the icons on the Watch Recordings screen mean?
<p>Press "1" or F1 to get a popup.
<sect1>What is the difference between a PVR-250 and a PVR-350
<p>This is covered in the hardware section, and extensively covered on the
Hauppauge website.  Briefly recapping:

A PVR-250 (model 980) is primarily a MPEG-2 encoder.  It has a tuner,
composite and SVideo connection for video, and an 1/8" audio jack for stereo
analog audio.  It also has an IR receiver and comes with a remote control.

The PVR-250 MCE (Media Center Edition, aka model 975)) contains a FM radio
tuner.  The tuner is currently not support by MythTV.  The PVR-250 MCE does
not contain a IR receiver or a remote.

The PVR-250 Rev 1 contained an MPEG-2 decoder.  However, this function was
not connected to any output jacks, and there doesn't appear to be any way to
pull decoded video from the card, so it's a fairly useless feature.

The PVR-350 (model 990) has the features of the PVR-250 as well as being
able to decode MPEG-2.  The encode and decode functions may be used
simultaneously.  The MPEG-2 decoder function gives superior video quality. 
However, the decoder function is only available once Linux has started, so
you will not see any boot-time messages.

Also, the card does not support any 3D functions, making it a poor gamer
card.

Non-MPEG-2 content will be displayed on the PVR-350 output using framebuffer
features, placing a large load on the host CPU.

<sect1>Changing channels on an external Set Top Box
<p>If you need to use an external Set Top Box (STB), such as for satellite
TV or for digital cable you will need some way for MythTV to tell the STB to
switch to a new channel.  There are several methods:
<enum>
<item>Use an IR blaster.  An IR blaster is an infrared transmitter connected
to your computer.  When MythTV needs to change channels it will send IR
pulses, thereby emulating a remote control.
<item>Use a direct serial connection.  Some STB's have a serial port on the
back, although it may not look like a serial port.  It may look like a phone
jack, or a strange VGA connector.  It may be labeled "Low Speed Data".  A
direct serial connection is more reliable than an IR blaster.  Not all STB's
that have a Low Speed Data port have it enabled; you may need to convince
your service provider to turn it on.  Stating that you have a Tivo may help;
the Tivo has a direct-connect capability.
<item>Use a firewire connection.  There is a <tt>6200ch.c</tt> in the MythTV
contrib directory which may work for you.
</enum>
<sect1>Configuring one machine to flag all commercials.
<p>Commercial flagging can be CPU intensive.  By default, the backend that
created a recording is the one which will flag commercials.  You may wish to
use a different machine to run commercial flagging.

On the slower machine:

Start the backend setup program.  Advance through the pages until you get to
the Job Queue page.  Turn off the setting that says "Allow Commercial
Detection jobs", thereby preventing any commercial flagging jobs from
running on this machine.

Next, make sure that "Run Jobs only on original recording host" is turned
OFF so that new jobs are allowed to run anywhere.

Restart <bf>mythbackend</bf> since it only reads this setting when it starts up.

On the faster machine:

Start the backend setup program.  Advance through the pages until you get to
the Job Queue page.  Ensure that "Allow Commercial Detection jobs" is turned
ON for this machine.

Run <bf>mythjobqueue</bf>.  <bf>mythjobqueue</bf> will examine the JobQueue
and run any jobs it finds.  <bf>mythjobqueue</bf> should be left running so
that it will pick up any new commercial flagging jobs that are added to the
queue, otherwise new jobs will be added to the queue and your programs won't
be flagged until you run manually run <bf>mythjobqueue</bf>.

Install the Mandrake kernel source.  If you are using a different Mandrake
kernel level (ie, not 2.4.21-0.16mdk as in the example below, then alter the
<bf>urpmi</bf> command appropriately.)

Download the latest IVTV driver from Sourceforge.  Check <url
url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ivtv/"
name="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ivtv/"> for the current version. 
Right now (2004-01-21), it's 0.1.9.  Untar the file.
<tscreen><verb>
$ tar -xzf ivtv-0.1.9.tar.gz
</verb></tscreen>

This should create an ivtv directory.  Switch to it and perform the
following commands:
<tscreen><verb>
$ cd ivtv/utils
$ wget http://hauppauge.lightpath.net/software/pvr250/pvr250_17_21288.exe
$ su
# ./ivtvfwextract.pl pvr250_17_21288.exe
# exit
$ cd ../driver
</verb></tscreen>

The <bf>ivtvfwextract</bf> program extracts the firmware required for the
card.  You may want to go to the Hauppauge website and download the latest
Windows driver if the <bf>wget</bf> command fails.

ivtv also needs to know how your kernel was compiled.  The default Makefile
is not configured for the way Mandrake "does things".  At the top of the
Makefile in the <tt>driver</tt> directory is a line like this:
<tscreen><verb>
KERNELDIR= /lib/modules/$(KERNVER)/build
</verb></tscreen>
edit it so that it looks like:
<tscreen><verb>
KERNELDIR= /usr/src/linux
</verb></tscreen>

</figure>
At this point we need to ensure that there are no other versions of
<tt>msp3400.o</tt> that would be loaded instead of the version that is
created by ivtv.  Note that in the command below we are using the backtick,
usually located on the same key as the tilde "~" and not the single quote.
<tscreen><verb>

# find . -name "msp3400*" | xargs rm -f
</verb></tscreen>

Next, copy the files that were compiled in the driver directory into the
appropriate modules directory:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# make install
# depmod -ae
</verb></tscreen>

Finally, load the ivtv driver:
<tscreen><verb>
# modprobe ivtv
# exit
</verb></tscreen>

Check that the card is being recognized on the PCI bus:
<tscreen><verb>
$ lspci -v
<snip>

00:0c.0 Multimedia video controller: Internext Compression Inc iTVC15 MPEG-2
Encoder (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Hauppauge computer works Inc.: Unknown device 4801
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 11
        Memory at d0000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=64M]
        Capabilities: <available only to root>
</verb></tscreen>

If you don't see your card on the PCI bus, make sure that it's been
installed in a bus-master slot.  For some motherboards, only the PCI slots
closest to the AGP slot are bus-mastering.

Check that the ivtv driver has created a new video device:
<tscreen><verb>
$ ls -l /dev/v4l/vi*
crw-------    1 mythtv   sys       81, 224 Dec 31  1969 vbi0
crw-------    1 mythtv   sys       81,   0 Dec 31  1969 video0
crw-------    1 mythtv   sys       81,  32 Dec 31  1969 video32
</verb></tscreen>

In this case, the ivtv device is <tt>video0</tt>.

You can now add this card available to MythTV.  Go into your mythtv setup
directory on the machine hosting the hardware MPEG-2 card.
When you add a new capture card, ensure that you are using the
<tt>video0</tt> device.  

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  As of 2003-04-25 the ivtv driver does not support VBI, so
closed-captioning is not available.
</caption>
</figure>
Leave the VBI device, audio device and audio sampling rate limit at the
default values.  Change the default input to an appropriate setting for your
configuration.  Change the card type to "Hardware MPEG Encoder Card" and
press ENTER.

The remaining setup is just like a standard V4L card; define a video source
if you have not already done so, and assign the video source to a video card
input on the Input Connections screen.

Some people report issues with the ivtv module not being loaded when
required by MythTV.  To get around this, you can <bf>modprobe</bf> the ivtv driver
before using it.  The simplest technique is to add the <bf>modprobe</bf>
command to <tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
# echo "/sbin/modprobe ivtv" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local

<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  some people complain
that their PVR-250/350 card is not capturing audio.  The most likely source
for this is that your system is not loading the correct msp3400.o file; ivtv
uses a custom msp3400.c, and if the resulting module isn't loaded you will
not get sound.  Switch to your <tt>/lib/modules</tt> directory and rename
the existing msp3400.o file, then copy the <tt>msp3400.o</tt> from the ivtv

example, Mandrake has a <tt>msp3400.o.gz</tt> in the <tt>3rdparty</tt>
subdirectory which will take precedence over the custom version created by
ivtv.  You can check if you have the correct msp3400 loaded by typing (as
root): <tt>modinfo msp3400 | grep "parm: *standard"</tt>.  If you don't get
a line that says: "parm:        standard int", then you're not loading the

These instructions work for Mandrake 9.2 on a frontend machine which is
hosting a single PVR-250 capture card using MythTV's native LIRC support.

First, you need to ensure that you've installed the kernel source
appropriate for the kernel that you're running.  In this case, we're using
kernel 2.4.22-9, so when installing the kernel-source ensure that you've got
the correct version.

<tscreen><verb>

</verb></tscreen>

If you've already installed LIRC from the Mandrake packages, it's going to
be version 0.6.6, and that won't work.  Uninstall it:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# urpme lirc lirc-remotes liblirc-devel
# rm -rf /dev/lirc*
# exit
</verb></tscreen>

Check to ensure that you don't have other versions of lirc modules and
programs on your system:
<tscreen><verb>

As you can see, there were a number of different versions of lirc already
installed on this system.  They must be removed.  We don't care about the
source code or the man pages, only the executables and the kernel modules.
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# rm -rf /lib/modules/2.4.22-9mdk/kernel/3rdparty/lirc

Download the lirc-0.7.0pre2 tarball:
<tscreen><verb>

$ tar -xjf lirc-0.7.0pre2.tar.bz2
</verb></tscreen>

Mandrake now includes i2c version 2.8.0 which changes the semantics of some
low-level calls.  You will need to patch LIRC in order for it to work
correctly.  Download the patch and install:
<tscreen><verb>
$ cd lirc-0.7.0pre2
$ wget http://delvare.nerim.net/i2c/other/lirc-CVS-i2c-2.8.0.patch
$ patch -p1 < lirc-CVS-i2c-2.8.0.patch
</verb></tscreen>

Next, run the LIRC setup program:
<tscreen><verb>
$ ./setup.sh
</verb></tscreen>

Select "1" (Driver configuration), then scroll down to "5" (TV Card), press
ENTER, then scroll down to "f" (Hauppauge TV card) and press ENTER again. 
Once back at the main menu, press "3" for Save and run configure.

If your build environment is ready, LIRC will create a Makefile for you. 
Switch to root and compile:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# make
# make install

To check that your remote is working correctly, run the <bf>irw</bf> program
and start pressing buttons.  If nothing is happening, you must begin
troubleshooting.  Things to check:
<itemize>
<item>Are there batteries in the remote?  
<item>Does the remote work?  You may be able to see the
flashes of IR coming from the remote if you look at it with a video camera.
<item>Is the IR dongle cable plugged in?
<item>Did you remove all of the old LIRC device drivers?  Run "updatedb" as
root, then "locate lirc_i2c".  The only lirc_i2c should be the one in the
misc/ directory for your kernel version.
<item>Did you run depmod?
<item>Is your modules.conf setup correctly?
<item>Did you modprobe lirc_i2c?
<item>Did you run lircd?
<item>Do you have an /etc/lircd.conf?
<item>Is /dev/lirc a character mode file, major 61, minor 0?  Is it readable
by all groups?
<item>If you think you may have had old LIRC device drivers you may need to
reboot to ensure that they're totally out of the system.  Try running
modprobe -r lirc_i2c as root first, then modprobe lirc_i2c and try again.
<item>What path does modinfo lirc_i2c and modinfo lirc_dev show?  It
should be in /lib/modules/{your kernel version}/misc/
</itemize>

If none of the above works, and <bf>irw</bf> still isn't showing keypresses,
then you will need to ask your question on the LIRC list.

Assuming that <bf>irw</bf> is showing keypresses, you can continue:
To enable native LIRC support within MythTV, you will need to modify your
<tt>settings.pro</tt> file and recompile.  Your <tt>settings.pro</tt> should
look like this:
<tscreen><verb>
# Native lirc support
CONFIG += using_lirc
LIRC_LIBS = -llirc_client
</verb></tscreen>

Recompile and install:
<tscreen><verb>
$ make distclean; make
$ su
# make install
</verb></tscreen>

If you're not using native LIRC support, ensure that the button names that
come up with <bf>irw</bf> match the ones in the <tt>.lircrc</tt> file in
your home directory.  Note that if you are not using native LIRC support,
the <tt>.lircrc</tt> file is in your home directory and has a "." as the first
character.

Since we're using native LIRC support within MythTV, copy the
<tt>configfiles/hauppauge-lircrc-nativelirc</tt> file into your
<tt>.mythtv/</tt> directory and call it <tt>lircrc</tt>.  It has a slightly
different format than what you would use if you were using
<bf>irxevent</bf>.  Also note that it is in your <tt>.mythtv</tt> directory
and does <em>not</em> have a "." in the filename.  

<tscreen><verb>
$ cp configfiles/hauppauge-lircrc-nativelirc ~/.mythtv/lircrc
</verb></tscreen>

Add the commands to load the LIRC device drivers and start <bf>lircd</bf> to
your <tt>rc.local</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# echo "modprobe lirc_i2c" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local
# echo "/usr/local/sbin/lircd" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local
# exit
</verb></tscreen>

You should now have native LIRC support within MythTV.

<sect1>Logical Volume Manager (LVM) <label id="LVM">
<!-- Contributed by Martin Smith martin at spamcop.net -->
<p>LVM greatly increases the flexibility you have in managing your storage
than traditional physical partitions. This section will provide some brief
notes on how to use LVM to create storage space for your video files and how
to add additional disk space in the future. There's lots more that can be
done with LVM, so check the LVM HOWTO <url
url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/"
name="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/"> document for details.

If you don't understand how to partition a drive, or how to change the
partition type you should stop and look at documentation on how to perform
these steps.

<figure loc="here">
<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption>
<bf>BIG FAT WARNING</bf>:  Using an incorrect parameter can make your files
inaccessible, prevent your computer from booting, etc.  Be careful!
</caption>
</figure>

Make sure your kernel configuration includes LVM support or that it's
available as a module. Today, most vendors include this by default. You'll
also want to ensure that you have a copy of the LVM utilities; check your
distribution, or get the latest versions from <url
url="http://www.sistina.com/products_lvm.htm"
name="http://www.sistina.com/products_lvm.htm"> and build them manually.

Check that the <bf>vgscan</bf> program is being run at some point during
your boot sequence - most distributions do this by default. Look for a
message during boot up that looks like this: <tt>vgscan -- reading all
physical volumes (this may take a while...)</tt> If you don't see any
messages during boot, you may need to install a LVM init script or confirm
that you have all of the LVM packages installed from your distribution.

LVM uses a few concepts you should be familiar with before starting.
<itemize>
<item>PV (Physical Volume).  The actual partition on the hard drive.
<item>VG (Volume Group).  The aggregation of all the PVs make a VG.
<item>LV (Logical Volume).  Subdivision of the pool of space available in
the VG into individual chunks, like /usr, /var/video, etc.
</itemize>

The following example assumes that you want to create a LVM partition from a
chunk of space in /dev/hda5, using a reiserfs filesystem and mounted on
/var/video. You later decide to extend this filesystem by adding a new disk:
/dev/hdb.

You need to create at least one LVM partition for a physical volume. Use
<bf>fdisk</bf> or your favorite partition editor to set the type to LVM
(0x8e). If you're using an entire disk, create one big partition rather than
using the device itself. e.g. use /dev/hdb1 not /dev/hdb.  

In the following example, you have a 15GB disk.  The first 6GB are set as
your boot partition.  <tt>/dev/hda2</tt> was added as an extended partition,
and within that partition you created the <tt>/dev/hda5</tt> linux (ext2)
partition.

<tscreen><verb>
# fdisk /dev/hda

The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 1823.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs

</verb></tscreen>

Create the LVM physical volume from the partitions (repeat if you have
multiple partitions to use):
<tscreen><verb>
# pvcreate /dev/hda5
</verb></tscreen>
Create a LVM volume group out of this physical volume called "VGforMyth" that is
allocated in chunks that are a multiple of 64MB
<tscreen><verb>
# vgcreate VGforMyth -s 64m /dev/hda5
</verb></tscreen>
Create a logical volume of 5GB called "video" and then create the reiserfs
filesystem and mount it:
<tscreen><verb>
# lvcreate --name video --size 5G VGforMyth
# mkreiserfs /dev/VGforMyth/video
# mount /dev/VGforMyth/video /var/video
</verb></tscreen>
Now create a 3GB volume for mythmusic files if you like:
<tscreen><verb>
# lvcreate --name music --size 3G VGforMyth
# mkreiserfs /dev/VGforMyth/music
# mount /dev/VGforMyth/music /var/music
</verb></tscreen>
Display the volume group status:
<tt># vgdisplay -v</tt>

Now, lets suppose you want to add a 60GB hard disk to the system as hdb and
allocate 50GB of it to video storage.

First, create a single partition /dev/hdb1 covering the whole disk and make
it type 0x8e using your partition editor.

<tt># fdisk /dev/hdb</tt>
.... create partition, set type, save and reboot if it says you have to

Create the new LVM physical volume:

<tt># pvcreate /dev/hdb1</tt>

Add the new physical volume to the volume group:

<tt># vgextend VGforMyth /dev/hdb1</tt>

<eps file="stop.eps" height="1cm">
<img src="stop.png">
<caption><bf>NOTE</bf>:  You may get errors at this point stating that there are no
physical volumes available for adding to the LV, even though you know for a
fact that there are.  You may need to specify the physical volume in the 
<tt>/dev/ide/host/bus/target/lun/etc</tt> format.

</figure>
Once you've completed one of the following two procedures, use <bf>df</bf>
to check that you've got more space.

<sect2>ReiserFS
<p>Make the logical volume used for video bigger:

<tt># lvextend --size +50G /dev/VGforMyth/video</tt>

Unmount, resize and remount the filesystem.  Technically, you don't need to
unmount and remount the ReiserFS. 
<tscreen><verb>
# umount /var/video
# resize_reiserfs /dev/VGforMyth/video
# mount /dev/VGforMyth/video /var/video
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>ext2 or ext3
<p>LVM comes with a program called <bf>e2fsadm</bf>.

Unmount, resize and remount the filesystem.  The filesystem <em>must</em> be
unmounted during this procedure.
<tscreen><verb>
# umount /var/video
# e2fsadm --size +50G /dev/VGforMyth/video
# mount /dev/VGforMyth/video /var/video
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Advanced Partition Formatting <label
id="advancedpartitionformatting">
<p>The partitions that your distribution sets up for you may not be
optimized for large files. Using LVM in conjunction with the following
techniques can be quite useful.

Unlike a typical filesystem, a MythTV video partition is usually a very
large filesystem filled with a fairly small number of large files.
Filesystem I/O is usually not an issue, even in multi-tuner and/or
multi-frontend setups.

There is however, one aspect of filesystem performance that can have a
bearing on the performance of MythTV.  In Linux, deleting a file will
utilize I/O bandwidth until the deletion has been completed.  If deleting
the file takes long enough, the video capture buffer may overrun, thereby
resulting in dropped frames.  Some filesystems are faster at deleting files
than others and, for multi-gigbyte MythTV video files, these differences can
be significant.

Fortunately, there are published tests (<url
url="http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html"
name="http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html">) that provide
insight into filesystem performance under conditions relevant to MythTV
usage.  In addition, some limited testing (archived at <url
url="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/users/52672"
name="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/users/52672">)
with very large files (10 gigabytes) was reported in the MythTV Users
mailing list.

<sect2>Ext2
<p>Ext2 was the defacto standard Linux filesystem for many years.  It is
stable, provides good I/O performance and can quickly delete large files. 
The primary disadvantage of Ext2 is that it is not a journaling filesystem,
so a file system consistency check (fsck, which is normally only performed
after a system crash) can take many hours on a filesystem the size of a
typical MythTV partition.

<sect2>Ext3
<p>Ext3 is Ext2 with a journal, so your biggest gain is that in case of a
crash and reboot you won't have to wait very long for your partition to be
remounted.

There are options available when formatting an Ext3 partition, as in:
<tscreen><verb>
# mkfs.ext3 -T largefile4 /dev/hdb1
</verb></tscreen>

This example assumes that <tt>/dev/hdb1</tt> has already been created using
<bf>fdisk</bf>. If you're using LVM, <tt>/dev/hdb1</tt> may be something like
<tt>/dev/VGforMyth/video</tt>.

The "-T largefile4" option creates one inode per 4 megabytes, which can
provide a few percent more storage space.  However, tests indicate that
using the "-T largefile4" option can drastically increase the amount of time
required to delete a large file and thus it should only be used with encoder
settings that produce small video files (YMMV).

You can check on your filesystem using the <bf>dumpe2fs</bf> program. See
the man page for details.
<sect2>ReiserFS
<p>The Reiser filesystem is another journaling filesystem commonly
distributed with Linux.  It is known to be an extremely efficient filesystem
and it especially excels at managing partitions containing a large number of
small files.  However, tests indicate it is not the fastest at deleting very
large files.  For that reason, it may not be the best choice when using
encoder bitrates that produce very large files.

<sect2>JFS
<p>JFS (Journaling File System) is a journaling filesystem originally
developed by IBM for AIX which was later released as open source.  While not
as common as Ext3 or ReiserFS, it is distributed with RedHat 9 (RH9) and
Fedora Core 1 (RHFC1) and Mandrake as well as other distros.  According to
tests, JFS is the file deletion speed king, deleting virtually any file in
under one second, even files as large as 10 gigabytes.

<sect2>XFS
<p>XFS is a journaling file system originally developed by SGI for Irix, and
later released as open source.  While not a part of the default RedHat Linux
9 or Fedora Core installation (although it is a part of Mandrake and Fedora
Core 2), it can be easily installed via ATrpms.  XFS provides deletion
speeds for large files only slightly slower than JFS.  According to the test
results shown at (<url
url="http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html"
name="http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html">), XFS provide
higher I/O rates than JFS, albeit at a higher CPU loading.  This may cause
issues if you do not have the spare CPU capacity to handle XFS, potentially
leading to dropped frames.

<sect1>HDTV with the Air2PC-ATSC-PCI card

<p>The Air2PC card has the capability to capture over-the-air HDTV signals
(8VSB) and unencrypted HDTV (QAM) off of cable TV.  The Air2PC card is
installed as a DVB device and is supported within MythTV.  

First, you must compile a version of the Linux kernel to support the new
tuner device.  Version 2.6.11 supports the card in 8VSB mode.  If you wish
to use QAM, you will need to patch the kernel, or wait until 2.6.12.

Download the source to 2.6.11.  At the time of this writing (2005-02-09), the latest
is 2.6.11-rc3.
<tscreen><verb>
$ su
# cd /usr/src
# wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/linux-2.6.11-rc3.tar.bz2
# tar -xjf linux-2.6.11-rc3.tar.bz2
# pushd .
# cd linux-2.6.11-rc3/drivers/media/dvb/frontends
# wget http://www.digitalregime.com/patches/nxt2002-qam.patch
# patch -p0 < nxt2002-qam.patch
# popd
</verb></tscreen>

If you already have a 2.6 kernel running, copy the <tt>.config</tt> file and
use it as your starting point.  If not, then go straight to the <tt>make
menuconfig</tt> portion below.

On Debian with a 2.6.10 kernel:

<tscreen><verb>
# cp /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/.config .
# make oldconfig
</verb></tscreen>
Read the prompts that come up; for the most part you should be able to
answer "No".
<tscreen><verb>
# make menuconfig
</verb></tscreen>

Go to the Device Drivers->Multimedia->Digital Video Broadcasting Devices

Enable DVB for Linux and select B2C2/Technisat Air/Sky/CableStar 2 PCI.

Exit menuconfig, then compile modules and the kernel:
<tscreen><verb>
# make modules
# make
# make install
</verb></tscreen>

Make any modifications necessary to your boot configuration files; lilo or
grub.

Download and compile the dvb applications you'll need to configure the card. 
At the password prompt, press ENTER.
<tscreen><verb>
$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@linuxtv.org:/cvs/linuxtv login
$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@linuxtv.org:/cvs/linuxtv co dvb-apps dvb-kernel
$ cd dvb-apps
$ make
$ su
# cp utils/szap/azap /usr/local/bin
# cp ~/dvb-kernel/firmware/dvb-fe-nxt2002.fw /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware
# exit
</verb></tscreen>

Shutdown your machine, install the card and restart.  Ensure that you're
using your newly compiled kernel.

Once you've rebooted, confirm that the card is detected.
