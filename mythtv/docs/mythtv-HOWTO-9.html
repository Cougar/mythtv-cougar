</H2>

<P>Open a shell and decide where you will store your video files.  By
default, MythTV will assume that you will be using <CODE>/mnt/store/</CODE>, but
if this directory doesn't exist, or it exists and you don't have write
privileges to it then MythTV will fail when you attempt to make a recording. 
The following example is specific for <CODE>/var/video</CODE>, but the same
instructions would apply if you want to keep the default but don't have the
directory structure setup yet.  See the 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-22.html#advancedpartitionformatting">Advanced Partition Formatting</A> section for hints on creating a
partition for MythTV.</P>
<P>If you create a <CODE>/var/video</CODE> subdirectory, change
<CODE>/mnt/store/</CODE> to <CODE>/var/video/</CODE> in the setup screens.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

$ su
# mkdir /var/video

</P>
<P>The first thing to configure is the Master backend system.  If you are
running multiple backend systems, the Master backend will make all
decisions about which programs will be recorded on which tuners.  If you
have only one backend, then it will be its own master.</P>
<P>The Master backend will always choose the first available tuner in the same
order as you add cards through "setup". In other words, the second card you
add will only be used when there are two overlapping recordings, the third
when there are three, and so on. Therefore, you will want to have the
greatest amount of disk space on the Master backend because its tuner will
always be the first choice. You will then want to add your 
<A HREF="#nonmaster_backend">other backends</A> in the order of your
preference for recording.</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="warning.eps">
<IMG SRC="warning.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  It is possible to <EM>not</EM> have the cards on the Master
backend be the first ones used.  However, if you are new to MythTV it is
easier to configure the Master backend first before moving on to the Slaves,
at least until you become more familiar with the MythTV system.  See 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-21.html#advanced_backend_config">Advanced Backend Configurations</A> for
information on configuring multiple backend systems in various ways.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>
</P>
<P>Because MythTV now uses a database to store all configuration variables,
part of the bootstrap of MythTV is to indicate the location of the MySQL
database server. If the frontend, backend and MySQL database server are all
going to be running on the same box, you can continue to the next step.  If
not, you'll need to edit the <CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv/mysql.txt</CODE> or
<CODE>~/.mythtv/mysql.txt</CODE> file and change the first line to the IP
address of the database server.  Customizing <CODE>~/.mythtv/mysql.txt</CODE> is
preferred, since changes to <CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv/mysql.txt</CODE> will
be lost the next time you upgrade. All other configuration is within the
MythTV GUI screens.</P>

<P>Switch to the setup directory and run the setup program:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cd setup
$ ./setup
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The backend setup program will start and offer you a number of choices.  It
is <EM>strongly</EM> recommended that you go through them in order.</P>
<P>The first question will ask if you wish to clear out your existing
configurations for your capture cards.  Initially, you should say "YES" so
that there are no surprises later.</P>
<P>The next question will ask you if you wish to clear out your video source
information.  You should answer "YES" to this as well.</P>
<P>Once the graphical setup starts, you'll see that there are five choices.
<OL>
<LI>General</LI>
<LI>Capture Cards</LI>
<LI>Video Sources</LI>
<LI>Input Connections</LI>
<LI>Channel Editor</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Use the arrow keys to move around, and press the space bar to select which
option you wish to configure.</P>

<H3>General</H3>

<P>The first screen of the General configuration deals with IP addresses of the
system that you're running setup on and any master backend you may have.  If
you've only got one machine, then the default values are fine and you can
move to the next page by pressing the space bar.  If you need to move around
the screen, use the arrow keys to move focus between settings, not the
mouse.</P>
<P>If you will have multiple backends, or if your backend is on one system and
you're running the frontend on another machine then <EM>do not</EM> use the
"127.0.0.1" IP address.</P>
<P>It is very strongly discouraged that you make any changes to the port
settings from the defaults.</P>
<P>Once you're satisfied with the values, move the focus down to Next and hit
the space bar.</P>
<P>The next screen details the Host-specific Backend setup.  This is where you
will set the specific directory paths for this particular backend.  Make
sure that you've followed the steps at the beginning of this section and
created a directory that exists and that MythTV will have write privileges
to.  When you're done, press Next to continue, taking you to the Global
Backend Setup.</P>
<P>On the Global Backend Setup configure your backend with the appropriate
settings.  Use the left and right arrow keys to iterate through the choices
available on each setting, and the up and down keys to move between
settings.  Move to Finish when you're done and press the space bar, taking
you back to the main configuration screen.</P>

<H3>Capture Cards</H3>

<P>You should have no capture cards defined, so the highlight will be on
(New Capture Card).  Press space to begin.</P>
<P>Choose the appropriate settings for your particular tuner.  Use the arrow
keys to move around and to make your choices, and press RETURN when
complete.  Pressing RETURN will take you back to the Capture Cards screen;
if you have additional capture cards in this machine, press the space bar
when the highlight is on the (New Capture Card) row to define another card. 
Once you have no additional cards to setup, press ESC.</P>

<H3><A NAME="VideoSources"></A> Video Sources </H3>

<P>When you start, the highlight should be on (New Video Source).  Press the
space bar to begin.  The first field asks for the name of the video source.
You may choose something easy to remember, like "Antenna" or "Cable".  Once
you've chosen a name, press the down arrow to move to the next field.  </P>
<P>If you're in North America, change the grabber to "DataDirect", then
continue pressing the down arrow to move to the next field.  Fill in the
username and password that you have established with DataDirect, then move
to the "Retrieve Listings" button and press the space bar.  </P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: You need <B>wget</B> version 1.9.1 or higher to use
DataDirect.</P>
<P>The setup program will contact the Zap2It servers and get your account
information.  Once you're done, you may click the Finish button and skip the
next few paragraphs in this document since they only apply to users that are
using the external XMLTV script to get their guide data.</P>
<P>If you wish to continue using the XMLTV grabber, then move to the Zip/postal
code field and put in the appropriate value.</P>
<P>If you're outside of North America, then some manual interaction will be
required with XMLTV.</P>
<P>Once you have chosen your provider, press RETURN to continue.  XMLTV will
now begin collecting the initial data for your location.  The screen may
blank for a few seconds to several minutes, depending on the load of the
listings provider and the speed of your connection to the Internet.  Be
patient!</P>
<P>You will then be returned to the Video Sources screen.  If you have multiple
video sources available, such as Antenna, Cable, etc, go ahead and define
them all, even if they're not all going to be physically connected to the
master backend server.  Once you're done, press ESC to return to the main
screen.</P>

<H3>Input Connections</H3>

<P>The final configuration item is Input Connections.  On this screen, you will
associate the various video sources you defined earlier with a physical
input to a encoder card.  It's entirely possible that you have multiple
tuners, and each tuner has a different input, so on this screen you let
MythTV know which device will connect to which input source.</P>
<P>When you start this screen, you should see a listing of the various input
connections available on each of the Capture cards you defined earlier.  For
example, you may have a capture card with a tuner, a SVideo and a Composite
connection.  If you wanted to associate the tuner (a.k.a., "Television") with
an "Antenna" source you defined in Video Sources, you would move to the
/dev/videodevice (Television) -> line and press the space bar.  Using the
left and right arrow keys will show you the various choices you have already
created for video source.  In our case, you would use the left/right cursor
keys until "Antenna" was shown in the Video Source field.  Press down to
move to the next setting, all of which should be self-explanatory.</P>
<P>Once you're done, press RETURN to go back to the Input Connections screen. 
You would then finish associating the video sources to any other hardware
devices you have available.</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="stop.eps">
<IMG SRC="stop.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  Don't add a video source to a hardware input if you don't
actually have anything connected there.  For example, adding "Cable" to the
Tuner and to the Composite inputs without having something connected to
Composite will lead to blank recordings.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>
</P>
<P>Press ESC to return to the main menu, and press ESC again if you have no
further items to configure, thereby returning you to the command line.</P>

<H3>Channel Editor</H3>

<P>The channel editor is used to globally alter channel information,
including items like hue, contrast, finetuning and others.  Users in North
America shouldn't run the channel editor until after completing initial
setup and running <B>mythfilldatabase</B> at least once to populate the
database.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc9.2">Post-configuration</A>
</H2>

<P>Run the <CODE>mythfilldatabase</CODE> program as directed.  The master
backend will obtain guide data for all the video sources you defined during
setup.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: If you are using DataDirect and watching the output messages
on the console or the log file it is normal to see a "401 Unauthorized"
error followed by a "200 OK" when the connection to Zap2It is being
established.

<P>Running mythbackend as a daemon and using the logfile option will allow you
to have mythbackend automatically start up during the boot process.  For
example, you may add this to your <CODE>rc.local</CODE> file, or you can follow
the steps outlined in the section called 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-21.html#mythbackend_autostart">Automatically starting mythbackend at system boot time</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="nonmaster_backend"></A> <A NAME="ss9.3">9.3</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc9.3">Configuring a non-master backend </A>
</H2>

<P>Ensure that you've granted access to the master MySQL database for remote
backends as discussed in the section titled 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-6.html#modify_perm_mysql">Modifying access to the MySQL database for multiple systems</A> and that
you've edited the <CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv/mysql.txt</CODE> or
<CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv/mysql.txt</CODE> file and put the correct IP
address for the database server.</P>
<P>Make sure that the IP addresses on the General setup screen are accurate. 
If the slave backend can't communicate with the master backend due to IP
address misconfiguration then MythTV will not function properly.</P>
<P>Configuration of a non-master backend follows the same general procedure
as that of the master backend, with the exception that you skip over the
"Video Sources" step.  All possible video sources need to be defined on the
master backend system; only the master backend will query a listings
provider to obtain guide data for all the non-master backends.</P>

<H3>Periodically running <B>mythfilldatabase</B></H3>

<P>In order to keep your database filled, <B>mythfilldatabase</B> should be
run once a day.</P>
<P>There are three ways to accomplish this:  use the built-in capability of
MythTV to run the <B>mythfilldatabase</B> program, as a user-based cron
job, or as a system based cron.  If you use a user-based cron, you can
select the time that the cron job will be run.  A system-based cron job will
run at the same time as any other system cron jobs.</P>

<H3>Using the built-in method.</H3>

<P>To use MythTV's built-in capability, you'll need to run the
<B>mythfrontend</B> Setup option.  From the MythFrontend, enter the
Setup>General screen and advance to "Mythfilldatabase", the fourth screen.
Select the checkbox, then complete the options as you see fit.  The
<B>mythbackend</B> program will now run <B>mythfilldatabase</B> at the
times you specify.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Don't use the built-in and cron methods at the same time. 
If you switch to the native method, ensure that you've removed any user or
system cron jobs that you may have been using.</P>
<H3>Using the cron method.</H3>

<P>If you are a Mandrake 9.0 user and wish to use a system cron job, you can
perform the following steps:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cd configfiles
$ su
# cp mythfilldatabasecron /etc/cron.daily
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you want to know what time your job will run, you can do the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>If you wish to specify a custom time, then the user-based cron job is the
better method.</P>
<P>The default <B>configfiles/mythcrontab</B> file will run the

</H2>

<P>While the DataDirect TV listings service has several advantages, it does
not support grabbing logo icons for the stations you receive. However, there
are utilities provided with MythTV which you may use to grab your initial
set of icons and to keep them updated if your lineups change.</P>
<P>First, you need to generate or obtain an XML file with the information for
your stations.</P>
<P>If you have XMLTV software installed, there is a perl script in MythTV's
<CODE>contrib/</CODE> directory which will generate this file for you. Run the
command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ perl mkiconmap.pl
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You will be asked for your zipcode and the service that you use. If there
are no errors, the <CODE>iconmap.xml</CODE> file that you need for the next step
will be created.</P>
<P>If you do not have XMLTV software installed and do not want to install it
for the sake of this minor task, there is a generic
<CODE>contrib/master_iconmap.xml</CODE> which you can copy and use but this may
not be as complete as using the specific information for your service.</P>
<P>Once you have an <CODE>iconmap.xml</CODE> file, add the icon information to your
