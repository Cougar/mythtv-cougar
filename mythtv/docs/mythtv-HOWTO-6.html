<P>If your video doesn't appear to be in-sync with your audio, it could be
because you are listening to the real-time audio from your video card rather
than after it's been processed and synchronized to the video by mythtv.</P>
<P>What you need to do is to mute the "line-in" of your sound card and also
set it as the recording source.</P>
<P>There are two ways to do this.  Graphically, and from the command line.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc6.1">Graphically setting up the mixer.</A>
</H2>

<P>Open Kmix by K->Multimedia->Sound->Kmix</P>
<P>Click on Settings->Configure  Make sure that "Tick Marks" and "Show
labels" have "X"'s in them.  This will make it easier to find the correct
audio source.  Click OK.</P>
<P>On the mixer page, look for Line-In on your sound card.  You should see
two LED's - a green one at the top, and a red one at the bottom.  The green
one at the top is for muting; you want to make sure that the green LED is a
dark green, meaning that it's "off".  You also want to click on the red LED
so that it turns bright red, indicating that it's "ON"; this insures that
the Line-in is used as the source.  Click OK, and make sure that you save
the settings so that this is your default.</P>

</H2>

<P>If you're running Mandrake 9.0 and have installed the alsa-utils package,
then the <B>amixer</B> program can be used to setup the mixer.</P>

That takes care of setting the volume correctly, and the alsa startup script
will restore the volume after a reboot.</P>
