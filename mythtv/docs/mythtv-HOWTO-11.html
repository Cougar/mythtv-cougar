<P><B>NOTE to Red Hat 8.0 users</B>:Red Hat Linux 8.0 ships with Gnome as
the default desktop environment.  However, Gnome seems to have issues with
window focus and window switching which sometimes cause mythfrontend to
obscure the video. KDE does not seem to have any such issues. Therefore you
will need to switch to KDE by selecting RedHatMenu>Extras>System
Settings>Desktop Switching Tool and choose "KDE".</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss11.1">11.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc11.1">Using themes with MythTV.</A>
</H2>

<P>MythTV is "themeable", meaning that the visual appearance of the program
can be modified by the user without re-compiling or altering the program
functionality.
<CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv/theme.txt</CODE> allows you to alter the theme
for MythTV.  The default theme is called "blue".  Other themes that ship
with MythTV can be found in the <CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv/themes</CODE>
directory.  </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.2">11.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc11.2">Adding DirecTV information to the database.</A>
</H2>

<P>A script for adding DirecTV information into the database has been
written by tarek Lubani 
<A HREF="mailto:tarek@tarek.2y.net">mailto:tarek@tarek.2y.net</A> and is
available at 
<A HREF="http://tarek.2y.net/myth/ppv.pl">http://tarek.2y.net/myth/ppv.pl</A>.  This is currently an external
user-supplied program, so if you have issues with the script, please contact
the author.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.3">11.3</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc11.3">Adding support for an external tuner.</A>
</H2>

<P>MythTV supports changing the channel on an external tuner.  If you have
an external tuner, such as a DirecTV or digital cable set top box, you
should add <CODE>/usr/local/bin/changechannel</CODE> to your Input Connections in the
mythbackend configuration GUI.</P>
<P>The <B>changechannel</B> program is not supplied with MythTV, so this is
going to be dependent on what sort of external tuner you have.  Example
scripts for Sony and RCA receivers can be obtained from 
<A HREF="http://tarek.2y.net/myth/">http://tarek.2y.net/myth/</A>.  This is currently an external
user-supplied program, so if you have issues with the script, please contact
the author.</P>
<P>Feel free to browse some of what sort of hardware is available at 
<A HREF="http://shop.store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/cablepacks.html">http://shop.store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/cablepacks.html</A>, or if
you wish to assemble your own, rather than purchase, the following may be
helpful:
