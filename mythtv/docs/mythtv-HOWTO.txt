  Initially, installation of MythTV seems like a huge task.  There are
  lots of dependencies, and various distributions seem to do the same
  thing different ways.  This document will attempt to give general
  installation instructions, as well as including distribution-specific
  instructions where necessary.

  [1m1.  First things first.[0m



         [1mNOTE[22m: Please note that I am [4mNOT[24m the author/programmer of
  the MythTV application!  I can not give you personalized installation
  support.  If you are having issues installing MythTV you should
  examine the archives, or post your question to the MythTV-users
  mailing list.  If you send me "Does MythTV work with 'X'"? messages I
  will simply delete your mail.

  [1m1.1.  What is MythTV?[0m

  MythTV is a GPL licensed suite of programs that allow you to build the
  mythical home media convergence box on your own using Open Source
  software and operating systems.

  MythTV has a number of capabilities.  The television portion allows
  you to do the following:

  +o  You may pause, fast-forward and rewind live Television.

  +o  You may install multiple video capture cards to record more than
     one program at a time.

  +o  You can have multiple servers, each with multiple capture cards in
     them.  All servers are centrally managed and all programs are
     scheduled by the Master backend.

  +o  You can have multiple clients (called "frontends" in MythTV
     parlance), each with a common view of all available programs.  Any
     client can watch any program that was recorded by any of the
     servers.  Clients can be diskless and controlled entirely by a
     remote control.

  +o  You may use any combination of standard analog capture card,
     MPEG-2, MJPEG, DVB or HDTV capture devices.  With appropriate
     hardware, MythTV can control set top boxes, often found in digital
     cable and satellite TV systems.

  +o  Program Guide Data in North America is downloaded from Zap2It.com,
     a subsidiary of Tribune Media Services.  This free service is
     called DataDirect, and provides MythTV almost two weeks of
     scheduling information.  Program Guide Data in other countries is
     obtained using XMLTV.  MythTV uses this information to create a
     schedule that maximizes the number of programs that can be recorded
     if you don't have enough tuners.

     Other modules in MythTV include:

  +o  MythGallery, a picture-viewing application

  +o  MythVideo, a media-viewer for content not created within MythTV

  +o  MythDVD, a DVD viewer / ripper

  +o  MythMusic, a music playing / ripping application which supports MP3
     and FLAC

  +o  MythGame

  +o  MythWeather

  +o  MythNews, a RSS news grabber

  +o  MythBrowser, a web browser

  +o  MythWeb, which allows you to control your MythTV system using a web
     browser.  With MythWeb, you can schedule recordings, delete files,
     change keybindings and more.  With proper security, you may even
     schedule a program over the Internet and have it immediately acted
     on by the scheduler.


  +o  MythPhone, phone and videophone using SIP.

  [1m1.2.  QuickStart[0m

  Custom mini-distributions are available to make it easier to install
  MythTV.  A mini-distribution removes many of the "general purpose"
  workstation / server software packages that may be installed by
  default if you use one of the big-name OS packages.

  See http://mysettopbox.tv <http://mysettopbox.tv> if you'd like to
  install a custom version of Knoppix optimized for MythTV.

  See http://linpvr.org/ <http://linpvr.org/> if you'd like to install
  MythTV onto a VIA Epia M machine.

  See http://bit.blkbk.com/ <http://bit.blkbk.com/> if you'd like to
  install MythTV on a Xbox.

  See http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/ <http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/> for
  instructions tailored to RedHat's Fedora Core distribution.

  [1m1.3.  Upgrading from previous versions[0m

  The upgrade from previous versions should be transparent.  Any changes
  to the database structure should be applied automatically.

  It is [4mstrongly[24m recommended that you back up your database before
  installing a new version of MythTV.

  See ``Saving or Restoring the database'' for instructions.


  [1m1.4.  How to obtain this document / PDF versions of this document[0m

  This HOWTO document is maintained at the primary MythTV website:
  http://www.mythtv.org <http://www.mythtv.org> by Robert Kulagowski
  <mailto:rkulagow@rocketmail.com>.

  This document is available as a single-page HTML document at

  at http://www.mythtv.org/docs/mythtv-HOWTO.pdf
  <http://www.mythtv.org/docs/mythtv-HOWTO.pdf>.

  This HOWTO is for MythTV v0.18.1


  [1m1.5.  Document conventions[0m

  The following conventions are used throughout this document.
  [1mboldface [22m- used for program names.
  typewriter - used for program paths.
  [4memphasis[24m - Pay attention here.



                           Pay more attention.



                        Ignore at your own peril.


  [1m1.6.  Mailing lists / getting help[0m

  It's recommended that you join the user list at
  http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-users
  <http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-users>.  The developer
  list is at http://mythtv.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-dev
  <http://mythtv.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-dev>.  Please keep
  the developer list strictly for development-related issues.

  Searchable archives for the lists are available at
  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/ <http://www.gossamer-
  threads.com/lists/mythtv/>.


  [1m1.7.  IRC[0m

  There are two IRC channels dedicated to MythTV which can be found on
  irc.freenode.net

  +o  mythtv

  +o  mythtv-users

  The mythtv channel is where the developers discuss code.  It is [4mnot[24m a
  user-support channel.  Please don't ask non-development related
  questions there.



  Really.  Even if there's no one in the mythtv-users IRC group or everyone
  seems to be ignoring you.

  [1m2.  Introduction.[0m

  This HOWTO document will focus on manually building MythTV in a North
  American environment. If you have installation instructions for a
  different region or Linux distribution, please send them to the author
  so that it can be included in other versions of this document.


  [1m3.  Checking prerequisites.[0m

  You must ensure that any firewalls (either hardware, or a software
  firewall installed by your distribution) will not block access to the
  ports that will be used by the MythTV clients and servers on the
  "inside" LAN.  The ports for MySQL (TCP port 3306) and mythbackend
  (TCP ports 6543 and 6544) must be open.  It is [4mstrongly[24m recommended
  that you do [4mnot[24m expose the MythTV and MySQL ports to the Internet or
  your "Outside" LAN.


  [1m3.1.  Hardware[0m

  Hardware selection is a complex topic, one this HOWTO will only
  discuss briefly and in general terms. The following subsections offer
  some general guidance but stop short of offering specific
  recommendations.

  For a good MythTV experience, you must understand that MythTV
  exercises your hardware more than a typical desktop. Encoder cards
  generate DMA across the PCI bus.  The CPU is busy encoding / decoding
  video. Hard drives are constantly reading and writing data. Building a
  MythTV system on older / "spare" hardware may be an exercise in
  frustration and can waste many hours of valuable time.

  For more detail about actual configurations that others have used,
  Mark Cooper has setup a hardware database at
  http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/ <http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/>. The website
  will let you browse what other users have reported as their hardware
  configuration, and how happy they are with the results.

  If you have specific questions about the suitability of specific
  hardware choices, you can consult the archives of the mythtv-users
  mailing list at http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/
  <http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/> or post a question to
  the list.

  [1m3.1.1.  CPU Type and Speed[0m

  Selection of CPU type and speed is one of the trickiest elements of
  hardware selection, mainly because there are so many tradeoffs which
  can be made.  For example, if you have plenty of CPU, you can use
  higher bitrates or capture sizes, etc.

  MythTV has two modes of operation.  First, it can function as a
  software video encoder, which means that it uses a fairly generic
  "dumb" video capture card to get frames of video, encodes them using
  the CPU on your motherboard and writes them to disk.  High-end video
  capture cards and devices like the TiVo and ReplayTV have dedicated
  encoder chips which use specialized hardware to convert the video
  stream to the MPEG-2 format without using the motherboard CPU.  The
  main CPU has the responsibility of running the Operating System and
  reading and writing the encoded frames to the disk.  These tasks have
  fairly low CPU requirements compared to encoding video, which is why a
  device like a Series 1 TiVo can run with only 16MB of RAM and a 54MHz
  CPU.

  There are many variables that go into the question: "How fast a CPU do
  I need to run MythTV"?  Obviously, the faster your CPU, the better
  your experience will be with MythTV.  If you are using the software
  MPEG-4 encoder and performing the "Watch TV" function, where the CPU
  is both encoding and decoding video simultaneously to allow Pause,
  Fast Forward and Rewind functions for live TV requires more CPU then
  just encoding or decoding.  MythTV also supports multiple encoder
  cards in a single PC, thereby increasing the CPU requirements if you
  plan on simultaneously encoding multiple programs.  As a general
  guideline, plan on 1GHz per encoder if you are doing software-based
  encoding, less if you are using a hardware-based encoder.

  Here are a few data points:

  +o  A PIII/733MHz system can encode one video stream using the MPEG-4
     codec using 480x480 capture resolution.  This does not allow for
     live TV watching, but does allow for encoding video and then
     watching it later.

  +o  A developer states that his AMD1800+ system can [1malmost [22mencode two
     MPEG-4 video streams and watch one program simultaneously.

  +o  A PIII/800MHz system with 512MB RAM can encode one video stream
     using the RTjpeg codec with 480x480 capture resolution and play it
     back simultaneously, thereby allowing live TV watching.

  +o  A dual Celeron/450MHz is able to view a 480x480 MPEG-4/3300kbps
     file created on a different system with 30% CPU usage.

  +o  A P4 2.4GHz machine can encode two 3300Kbps 480x480 MPEG-4 files
     and simultaneously serve content to a remote frontend.

  The second mode of operation is where MythTV is paired with a
  hardware-based video encoder, such as a Matrox G200 or a Hauppauge
  WinTV-PVR-150/250/350/500.  In this mode, because the video encoding
  is being done by a dedicated video processor, the host CPU
  requirements are quite low.  See the ``Video Capture Device'' section
  for details.

  If you have a Via M10000 series or a Hauppauge PVR-350, MythTV can use
  the hardware-based video decoder for playback, which further reduces
  CPU requirements.


  [1m3.1.2.  Memory[0m

  A MythTV host that is both a backend and a frontend and using software
  encoding with a single capture card should run adequately in 256MB of
  RAM.  Additional RAM above 256MB will not necessarily increase
  performance, but may be useful if you are running multiple encoders.


  [1m3.1.3.  Hard Disk(s)[0m

  Encoded video takes up a lot of hard disk space. The exact amount
  depends on the encoding scheme, the size of the raw images and the
  frames per second, but typical values for MythTV range from 700
  megabytes/hour for MPEG-4, 2 GB/hour for MPEG-2 and RTjpeg and 7
  GB/hour for ATSC HDTV.



         [1mNOTE[22m:  You [4mmust[24m use DMA for hard drive access to prevent
  choppy or jittery video.  Not all distributions enable DMA at boot
  time. See the Troubleshooting Section for ``instructions'' on how to
  do this.

  Writing video to disk is sensitive to timing issues; RTjpeg requires
  less CPU with the tradeoff being larger files and needing to write to
  the disk faster.  MPEG-4 requires more CPU, but the files are smaller.
  At the default resolution, MPEG-2 creates the largest files of all
  with almost no CPU impact.

  See the Troubleshooting ``section'' for more information.


  [1m3.1.4.  Filesystems[0m

  MythTV creates large files, many in excess of 2GB.  You [4mmust[24m use a
  filesystem that will allow you to create large files.  Filesystems
  known to have problems with large files are FAT and FAT32.

  Because MythTV creates very large files, a filesystem that does well
  at deleting large files is important.  Numerous benchmarks show that
  XFS and JFS do very well at this task.  You are strongly encouraged to
  consider either of these for your MythTV filesystem.

  Because of the size of the MythTV files, it may be useful to plan for
  future expansion right from the beginning.  If your case and power
  supply have the capacity for additional hard drives, read through the
  ``LVM'' and ``Advanced Partition Formatting'' sections for some
  pointers.


  [1m3.1.5.  Video Capture Device[0m

  In order to capture video, MythTV will need one or more video capture
  devices with Linux drivers.  There are a number of classes of hardware
  available for capturing video.

  [1m3.1.5.1.  Frame Grabbers.[0m

  This class of card is the simplest and is usually the cheapest.  There
  is no on-board encoding of the analog video; hardware known as a
  Digital-Analog Converter (DAC) takes the video and presents it to the
  computer in an essentially raw digital form.

  For a list of video capture cards known to work with Linux, please see
  /usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv for a partial listing;
  even if your specific card is not listed, it may be that the vendor is
  actually using a standard reference design and placing their own name
  on it.  See the video4linux mailing list
  (https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list
  <https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list>) for
  more information and for specific hardware questions.

  The most common inexpensive cards available use the Bt848 or Bt878
  video capture chip; examples are the "Hauppauge WinTV Go" card and the
  "AverTV Desktop PVR" card, both of which use the bttv kernel module.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  NOTE:  The ATI TV Wonder series and the ATI All-in-Wonder series of cards
  are not the same.  The All-in-Wonder cards will not work with MythTV.
  ______________________________________________________________________



        [1mNOTE[22m: The ATI All-in-Wonder cards (which are not the same
  as the ATI TV Wonder, TV Wonder VE or TV Wonder Pro) [4mwill[24m [4mnot[24m work as
  a MythTV capture device because the GATOS http://gatos.sourceforge.net
  <http://gatos.sourceforge.net> drivers that are available provide only
  a limited subset of the V4L API. The TV Wonder series of cards are
  supported by the Bt8x8 Video4Linux driver.

  Newer cards may use the CX23881 series of chips; a driver is available
  at http://bytesex.org/cx88/ <http://bytesex.org/cx88/>.

  After you have installed a suitable capture device, you can check that
  the kernel sees it with lspci. Look for an entry labeled "Multimedia
  video controller". To get more detailed information about the card,
  use lspci -v or lspci -vv.  Ensure that your system is loading the
  bttv modules by typing:


       # lsmod |grep bttv



  You want to see the bttv module listed.

  [1m3.1.5.2.  Hardware MPEG-2 encoders.[0m

  While inexpensive video-capture cards simply capture raw frames,
  leaving encoding to software, some higher-end cards incorporate
  hardware-based encoding. Using either a G200 MJPEG encoder card, or a
  MPEG-2 encoder card supported by the IvyTV project
  http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/ <http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/> such as
  the Hauppauge PVR-150/250/350/500, Avermedia M179, Hauppauge
  "Freestyle" or Yuan M600 cards will allow you to use dedicated
  hardware encoders rather than your CPU. (The PVR-350 can
  simultaneously be used as an output device.) Using the on-board MPEG-2
  encoder drastically reduces the CPU requirements for encoding.

  [1mNOTE[22m:  Motherboards with the Via chipset are notoriously bad with DMA
  and have caused numerous issues with ivtv, including hard locks.  See
  the ivtv website http://ivtv.sf.net <http://ivtv.sf.net> for the
  latest information on what works and what doesn't.

  Here are some data points for encoding:

  +o  A Celeron 450 uses 2% CPU for encoding a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2
     stream.

  Here are some data points for decoding:


  +o  An Athlon 1800XP can decode a 720x480 8Mbps MPEG-2 file using 10%
     CPU

  +o  An Athlon 1GHz can decode a 720x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file using 30-50%
     CPU, can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 using 30% CPU and
     approximately 30% for Live TV at 416x480.

  +o  A P3-550 can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file with 55% CPU.

  +o  A Celeron 450 (no SSE) can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file with
     80% CPU.

     See the ``Hauppauge PVR-250/350 hardware MPEG-2 encoder.'' section
     for information on installing a PVR-250 on Mandrake 9.1.  The
     information contained in the section will also apply to other
     MPEG-2 encoder cards supported by the IVTV driver.
  [1m3.1.5.3.  DVB capture cards.[0m

  DVB is a video standard primarily found in Europe.  MythTV supports
  DVB; see the pages maintained by Martin Smith martin@ethics-
  gradient.net <mailto:martin@ethics-gradient.net> at http://www.ethics-
  gradient.net/myth/mythdvb.html <http://www.ethics-
  gradient.net/myth/mythdvb.html> for more information.  To see if your
  DVB card is supported, see the list of cards at
  http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb/CARDS
  <http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb/CARDS> for more information.

  In the United States, you may use a card such as the TwinHan to obtain
  unencrypted Free-To-Air satellite channels.


  [1m3.1.5.4.  HDTV.[0m

  Currently there are two HDTV card with Linux drivers which are known
  to operate in the United States - the HD-2000/HD-3000 cards available
  from http://www.pchdtv.com/ <http://www.pchdtv.com/> or
  http://mythic.tv/ <http://mythic.tv/> and the Air2PC-ATSC-PCI
  available from
  http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&products_id=103
  <http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&products_id=103>
  or http://mythic.tv/ <http://mythic.tv/>.

  The Air2PC is supported using the linux-dvb drivers.

  To playback HDTV content, plan on a powerful CPU.  "How powerful?"
  depends on a number of factors, such as the capture resolution,
  whether the video is progressive or interlaced, and whether your
  display card has hardware-assist support for Linux. For 720p content
  (1280x720), a 2.4GHz P4 should be sufficient.

  For 1920x1080i->1920x1080p with the better deinterlacing methods done
  in real time a 2.4GHz CPU is taxed, but should work if you use "Bob
  and Weave" deinterlacing, or if you have an NVIDIA card with MPEG-2
  hardware acceleration.  If you enable the hardware acceleration, you
  may be able to use a 1.8GHz processor.


  [1m3.1.5.5.  Firewire.[0m

  You may use the Firewire output of the DCT6200 or the SA3250.


  [1m3.1.5.6.  DBoxII or other devices running Neutrino[0m

  You may use the Ethernet port of an DBoxII or a similar device to
  capture MPEG2. Your set top box has to be running the Neutrino GUI.


  [1m3.1.5.7.  USB Capture Devices.[0m

  The Plextor ConvertX PVR devices are supported through Linux drivers
  available from http://www.plextor.com/english/support/LinuxSDK.htm
  <http://www.plextor.com/english/support/LinuxSDK.htm>. MythTV uses the
  Plextor to capture hardware encoded MPEG-4, so the host CPU
  requirements are low.


  [1m3.1.6.  Hardware known NOT to work and other issues[0m


  +o  Hauppauge WinTV-D or -HD (no driver)

  +o  Hauppauge WinTV-USB series

  +o  Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-usb (model 602), or WinTV-PVR-PCI (model 880)
     cards (no driver - this is not the PVR-250/350 series of cards
     supported by the IvyTV driver)

  +o  Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-USB2 (driver available at
     http://justiceforall.free.fr/pvrusb2.html, no MythTV support)

  +o  ATI All-in-Wonder series

  There are no known consumer-level capture devices which will allow you
  to capture the HDTV output (either DVI or HDMI) from a set-top box
  commonly found with digital cable systems or satellite systems.

  There are no known consumer-level capture devices which will allow you
  to capture component output from a set-top box.

  [1m3.1.7.  Sound card[0m

  The system needs a sound card or an on-board equivalent on the
  motherboard to play back and in most cases, to record sound. Any sound
  card that can be operated by the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound
  Architecture) kernel modules will work with MythTV.  However, some
  cards and drivers will provide better quality or compatibility than
  others.  In particular, many audio devices included on motherboards
  can be problematic.

  The usual practice for capturing the audio associated with the video
  is to run a cable from an audio output on the video capture card to
  the Line input on a sound card. However, some video capture cards
  provide on-board audio capabilities that work with the kernel btaudio
  module instead, thereby eliminating the need for a cable.  This is
  useful if you will be using multiple capture cards in a single
  chassis, since each capture card will not need its own sound card.
  Note that a separate sound card is still required for playback when
  using btaudio, and that often the audio recorded in this way will be
  mono only.  See the ``btaudio'' section for more information.



   [1mNOTE[22m:  The MPEG-2 cards supported by the IVTV driver do not require
  a sound card for audio capture.



        [1mNOTE[22m:  Plugging a Line-level device into the Mic input is
  not recommended.  Line-level devices have higher voltages and can
  damage the sound card.  In addition, even if it doesn't break your
  card, you will be getting Mono sound.  See the Linux MP3 HOWTO at
  http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-
  formats/html_single/MP3-HOWTO.html#toc8
  <http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-
  formats/html_single/MP3-HOWTO.html#toc8> for additional information.


  [1m3.1.8.  Video Display Card[0m

  MythTV will work with just about any video card.  However, it is
  highly recommended that you use a card which supports XVideo (XV)
  extensions. If your card does not support XV, color conversion and
  scaling will be performed by your CPU rather than the video card.
  This is very CPU and memory intensive and will often result in dropped
  frames and a corresponding degradation of quality.  Check the XFree86
  documentation for details if you are uncertain about your preferred
  card.  You may also run xvinfo; look for your video card to be listed
  as one of the adapters.


  If you want to use MythTV with a standard television, you will need a
  physical connection from your video card to your TV set, which can
  either be a TV-out port on the card itself or an external adapter that
  converts the VGA signal to an appropriate video signal. "Appropriate"
  depends on a number of factors, such as video standard (NTSC vs. PAL)
  type of input connection (Composite vs. SVideo), etc.

  Note that with some video cards and X drivers, XVideo extensions are
  only supported on the VGA output, and not on the TV output.


  [1m3.1.9.  Cards with TV out[0m

  The next section deals with a number of cards that are known to have
  TV-out ports.  The list is unlikely to be complete, so if you know of
  others, please post a message to the mythtv-users mailing list so the
  information can be included in future versions of the HOWTO. The list
  is organized by manufacturer.

  Reports here are based on what users of the cards have posted on the
  mythtv-users mailing list, so if you need configuration details,
  please search the archives at http://www.gossamer-
  threads.com/lists/mythtv/ <http://www.gossamer-
  threads.com/lists/mythtv/> using the card name in your search string.


  [1m3.1.9.1.  ATI[0m

  ATI makes many cards with TV-out capability, but ATI offers no
  official support for their use with Linux. The standard XFree86 ati
  driver does not support TV-out.

  The enhanced ati.2 X driver created by the GATOS
  http://gatos.sourceforge.net <http://gatos.sourceforge.net> project
  offers some support for TV-out, but only in its "experimental"
  version, available through CVS. There have been reports from people
  who say they have made this driver work with one or another ATI card.
  For example, Bruce Markey  <mailto:bjm@lvcm.com> writes (on the
  mythtv-users mailing list): "I got this to work. You can quote me on
  that. I've used TV-out on several models of ATI cards both All-In-
  Wonder and regular cards with TV-out." See the "Adventurous Setup"
  section of http://gatos.sourceforge.net/watching_tv.php

  [1m3.1.9.2.  Matrox[0m

  The standard Matrox driver included with XFree86 does not support TV-
  out.

  Older Matrox cards can be used with a proprietary X driver provided by
  Matrox, and it does simultaneously support TV out and XVideo on some
  cards.  See http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/files/lnx_21.cfm
  <http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/files/lnx_21.cfm> for
  details.

  Newer Matrox cards can be run with a set of kernel patches (for kernel
  2.4.19) and a customized X driver, but this arrangement does not
  support XVideo on TV-out. See
  http://www.bglug.ca/matrox_tvout/g450_tvout_howto.html

  [1m3.1.9.3.  NVIDIA[0m

  Some NVIDIA cards with TV-out can be run using the standard nv driver
  in XFree86, combined with the userspace application [1mnvtv [22mto control
  the TV-out port. See http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/> for details.  Recent
  versions of the NVIDIA driver have better support for overscan and
  other features useful with TV-Out, so the [1mnvtv [22mapplication may not be
  required.

  Some NVIDIA cards can be run with a proprietary NVIDIA X driver made
  available by NVIDIA. See http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=linux
  <http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=linux> for more information.

  Specific cards:

  [1m3.1.9.5.  Hauppauge PVR-350[0m

  MythTV supports the TV-out and MPEG-2 decoder functions in the IvyTV
  driver.

  The PVR-350 is unique in that it also supports audio output. However,
  as of MythTV 0.17, the IvyTV drivers do not support volume control.
  There are two courses of action you may take:

  1. Take the audio output from the PVR-350 and plug it into an input on
     a sound card on your machine.  You may then use MythTV's internal
     audio controls.

  2. Take the audio output from the PVR-350 and connect it directly to
     your television / audio system.  You must indicate that you are
     using external audio control on the PVR-350 setup page.


  [1m3.1.9.6.  Other Options[0m

  Some devices with on-board TV-out capability, such as Xboxes converted
  to Linux and some laptops, can be used as MythTV frontends to display
  on a television screen. Please consult the mythtv-users mailing list
  for messages that report the details of these special arrangements.


  [1m3.1.10.  External Adapters[0m

  External adapters convert standard VGA output to a form suitable for
  display on a television. The output format varies by region, since
  different countries have different TV standards. People on the mythtv-
  users list have mentioned these adapters:


  +o  AITech Web Cable Plus, powered by external transformer or takes
     power from PS/2 keyboard connector, support resolutions up to
     1024x768, outputs composite and SVideo, provides position
     adjustment.

  +o  Averkey lite, powered by a USB port, has Composite, SVideo, YPbPr
     outputs; pan, brightness, overscan/underscan controls; supports up
     to 1024x768 outputs; and supports PAL and NTSC.

  +o  ADS TV Elite XGA

  +o  AverKey iMicro (comments are generally favorable)

     than the "Plus" version above)

  +o  TVIEW Gold (mentioned once, favorably)


  [1m3.2.  Software[0m

  There are a few ways of installing programs on Linux systems; you can
  either use a pre-compiled package, or install from a tarball after
  satisfying any prerequisites.
      [1mNOTE[22m: you must have the MySQL database software installed on a
  system to store the master database.  This does not necessarily mean
  that MySQL must run on one of the MythTV boxes.



    [1mNOTE[22m:  The following distributions have issues which may prevent a
  successful MythTV installation:

  +o  Suse 8.2 - Broken Qt package

  +o  Red Hat 8 - does not meet minimum version requirement for Qt (3.1+)


  [1m3.2.1.  Pre-compiled packages[0m

  A number of people have created pre-compiled packages for MythTV that
  may make your installation easier.



          [1mBIG FAT WARNING[22m:  This HOWTO assumes that you have [4mnot[0m
  installed MythTV from a package.  All example command lines and file
  locations are based on the MythTV tarball defaults.  Some packagers
  have modified the filenames, binaries and file locations to match what
  is commonly found in that distribution.  Any issues with MythTV
  installed via a pre-compiled package [1mMUST [22mbe raised with the packager.

  If you use any of the pre-compiled packages you may not need to
  perform any additional configuration steps in this HOWTO.  The next
  logical step is ``configuring MySQL'', which you may or may not have
  to perform.  See your package documentation.


  [1m3.2.1.1.  Red Hat Linux/Fedora Core[0m

  Red Hat Linux and Fedora Core 3 packages for MythTV and all of its
  add-on modules and some themes have been packaged by
  mailto:Axel.Thimm@ATrpms.net <mailto:Axel.Thimm@ATrpms.net> and are
  available at http://ATrpms.net/topic/multimedia/
  <http://ATrpms.net/topic/multimedia/>. All of the prerequisites for
  MythTV (such as XMLTV) are available as RPM packages. If you have
  problems with the RPMs, please contact the ATrpms lists at
  http://lists.ATrpms.net/ <http://lists.ATrpms.net/> or file a bug
  against http://bugzilla.ATrpms.net/ <http://bugzilla.ATrpms.net/>.

  Given the large number of dependent RPMs you are advised to use tools
  like apt or yum for automatic retrieval and installation of the
  required RPMs.  (http://ATrpms.net/install.html
  <http://ATrpms.net/install.html>) In this case a special meta-package
  called mythtv-suite will allow you to install all of MythTV and its
  add-ons, plus all dependencies.

  If you don't have [1mapt [22mor [1myum [22mon your machine, download and install the
  atrpms-kickstart package from http://ATrpms.net/name/atrpms-kickstart/
  <http://ATrpms.net/name/atrpms-kickstart/>.  Install the package with:


       # rpm -Uvh atrpms-kickstart*

  Then run:


       # apt-get update
       # apt-get dist-upgrade
       # apt-get update



  And finally:


       # apt-get install mythtv-suite



  These steps however, do NOT perform the installation of any drivers
  required for [1mALSA[22m, capture cards, [1mlirc kernel modules[22m, etc., nor do
  they set up your MythTV database. Check ATrpms
  <http://ATrpms.net/topic/multimedia/> for the drivers you need.

  Further documentation on using ATrpms packages can be found in Jarod
  Wilson's (mailto:jcw@wilsonet.com <mailto:jcw@wilsonet.com>) HOWTO at
  http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/ <http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/> Just like
  3rd-party packages, any 3rd-party documentation problems should be
  brought up with the 3rd-parties (maintainer, lists, bugzillas etc.).


  [1m3.2.1.2.  Mandrake[0m

  Thac has created RPMs for MythTV for Mandrake 9.0 and above which may
  be obtained from http://rpm.nyvalls.se/ <http://rpm.nyvalls.se/> If
  you have problems with the RPMs, please send him email directly at
  thac@nyvalls.se <thac@nyvalls.se>.


  [1m3.2.1.3.  Debian[0m

  Debian packages for MythTV and most of its add-on modules are
  maintained by Matt Zimmerman mailto:mdz@debian.org
  <mailto:mdz@debian.org> and are available at
  http://dijkstra.csh.rit.edu/~mdz/debian/dists/unstable/mythtv/
  <http://dijkstra.csh.rit.edu/~mdz/debian/dists/unstable/mythtv/>.
  Installation instructions can be found on those pages as well. All of
  the prerequisites for MythTV are available as Debian packages, most of
  them from the official Debian archive.

  If you have followed the instructions on the above page you should
  have added


       deb-src http://dijkstra.csh.rit.edu/~mdz/debian unstable mythtv



  to your /etc/apt/sources.list file.  Running [1mapt-get update [22mand then
  executing [1mapt-get build-dep mythtv [22mshould install all the pre-
  requisites required to compile MythTV.



   [1mNOTE[22m:  Due to the requirement for Qt 3.1+, there are no packages for
  Debian woody/stable.


  The Debian packages are configured such that MythTV programs should be
  run as the mythtv user, which is automatically created during
  installation.  This user has access to write new recordings to disk in
  the default directory, read and write the database, access the audio
  and video devices, and everything else that MythTV needs to do.


  See /usr/share/doc/[4mpackagename[24m/README.Debian for more information,
  including copies of the MythTV documentation.  The mythtv-doc package
  contains a copy of this HOWTO in /usr/share/doc/mythtv-doc.


  [1m3.2.2.  Manual installation[0m

  You may use the graphical tools that come with your distribution, or
  you can use command-line utilities.  Either system will get the job
  done, and it all depends on your comfort level with Linux.

  In order to compile MythTV, we need to make sure that the software it
  needs is installed.  As of 2003-03-15, this list includes [1mmysql[22m, [1mgcc[22m,
  [1mfreetype2-devel[22m, [1mXFree86-devel[22m, [1mqt-devel [22mand [1mlame[22m.  If you're going to
  use a remote control with MythTV, you're going to need the [1mcdialog[0m
  package in order to compile [1mlircd [22mif your distribution doesn't have a
  pre-packaged [1mlirc[22m.  If you are using [1mXMLTV [22mas a grabber, you will need
  [1mperl[22m.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  NOTE:  Qt v3.1 or higher is required.

  NOTE:  If you are going to be using RPMs to install various
  components, you should be aware that not all packages include the necessary
  headers for compiling packages.  If you're having trouble compiling, ensure
  that you've installed the -devel version of a prerequisite.
  ______________________________________________________________________



  [1m3.2.3.  Graphical installation tools[0m

  [1m3.2.3.1.  Mandrake[0m

  On systems running KDE, a tool which will allow you to see what
  packages are available and if they're installed on your system can be
  accessed by clicking K->Configuration->Packaging->KPackage

  While the graphical tools are nice, the command line tool is actually
  easier to use.  It's strongly recommended that you use the command
  line tool.

  There are many inter-related modules, so make sure that you've got the
  main package for each one, and not a sub package for an unrelated
  item.  For example, there are many modules that have "perl" in them;
  some are a part of the apache web server, others are a part of the
  perl distribution.  In each case, we're looking to make sure that the
  primary module is getting installed.

  Click the magnifying glass or press [1mCTRL-F [22mand enter "perl" as your
  search term.  You should find it under the "Perl" folder.  You need at
  least the perl 5.80 base package installed.  If not, click on the
  "Mark" button.
  If you are going to be installing MySQL on this system, search for
  mysql - it should be under "Databases".  Make sure that mysql and
  mysql-clients are installed.  If not, click on "Mark".

  Search for gcc.  You're going to need gcc and gcc-c++ installed.

  Search for freetype2.  Make sure that you've got freetype2 and
  freetype2-devel installed.

  Search for XFree86-devel.

  Finally, check for qt.  You'll need libqt3-devel (under folder "KDE
  and Qt") and libqt3 ("Libraries").



    NOTE for Mandrake users:  In versions after Mandrake 9.1, Mandrake
  removed the MySQL modules from the default installation.  Ensure that
  you install libqt3-mysql.

  Make sure that cdialog is installed if you want to use MythTV with a
  remote control if you need to compile [1mlirc [22mfrom source.

  alsa-utils is needed for setting the volume.  MythTV now has native
  volume support, but you may have a special configuration that
  necessitates an external program to adjust your volume settings.  If
  this is the case, then you can disable native volume support.

  If you marked anything to install, click on Install Marked.  Click
  "Yes" or OK if you get a message about satisfying dependencies.


  [1m3.2.4.  Command-line installation[0m

  This section details the various methods for installing prerequisites
  from the command line.


  [1m3.2.4.1.  Mandrake[0m

  [1murpmi [22mis the simplest tool for installation of packages from the
  command line, but properly configuring it can be difficult.  The
  following website http://addmedia.linuxfornewbies.org/
  <http://addmedia.linuxfornewbies.org/> will allow you to choose a
  mirror site and then present the command-line configuration text for
  that mirror.  You will most likely need to add a "Contrib" mirror to
  your setup.  If you add a site from the "Penguin Liberation Front",
  you will be able to load the lame library without compiling from
  source.


  [1m3.2.4.1.1.  Mandrake 9.0[0m

  The simplest tool for installing packages from the command line is
  [1murpmi[22m.

  Open a shell, and execute the following, all on the same line. You may
  get asked a number of questions regarding dependencies.  It's best to
  answer "YES".



  $ su
  # urpmi mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel cdialog alsa-utils
  # urpmi XFree86-devel perl
  # urpmi libqt3-devel



  ______________________________________________________________________
  NOTE for Mandrake 9.1+ users: execute the following command.

  # urpmi libqt3-mysql
  ______________________________________________________________________


  However, you might get this when you execute the command above:


       [root@pvr root]# urpmi mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel libqt3-devel alsa-utils XFree86-devel perl
       everything already installed



  In that case, you're ready to move to the next ``section''.  Once you
  have completed installing the pre-requisites, exit out of the shell
  and start a new one to ensure that any environment variables setup by
  the installation have a chance to take effect.

  [1m3.2.4.2.  Gentoo.[0m

  If Qt has not been installed on your system: Edit /etc/make.conf and
  locate the "USE" variable. If the line is commented out, remove the
  comment. The line should have at least:


       USE="mysql alsa"



  Next you need to build Qt. If you don't plan on using the ebuilds as
  described in the Gentoo section then you also need to install lame.


       # emerge lame mysql qt



  If you have already installed Qt: you will need to rebuild because the
  default installation doesn't include MySQL support, a requirement for
  MythTV.  To enable SQL support, add "mysql" to your USE variable in
  /etc/make.conf and rebuild Qt by running


       # emerge qt



  All the necessary files will be downloaded and built. Even on a fast
  machine this may take a lot of time if you need to do a full Qt build.

  [1m4.  System Configuration Requirements for Compiling MythTV.[0m

  Before you compile MythTV from the current source tarball or from
  [1msubversion[22m, you may need to modify your system configuration in a few
  ways.

  In general, if you install MythTV from pre-packaged binaries for your
  Linux distribution/version, you don't need to be too concerned about
  the issues in this section of the HOWTO - the install script for the
  packages should take care of them. However, this section is still
  recommended reading which may help if the packager skipped a step in
  their packaging.


  [1m4.1.  Software requirements for compiling MythTV[0m

  [1m4.1.1.  General requirements[0m

  MythTV is written in C++ and requires a fairly complete, but standard,
  compilation environment, including a recent g++ compiler, make, and
  appropriate headers files for shared libraries. Any standard Linux
  distribution should be able to install a suitable compilation
  environment from its packaging system. Section 3.2 of this HOWTO
  provides some details of how to install the required environment for
  many distributions.

  Subsequent sections of this chapter address the few oddities that you
  may have to adjust by hand before you compile MythTV.

  The reference compilation system for MythTV is Debian.


  [1m4.2.  Shared-Library Requirements for MythTV[0m

  [1m4.2.1.  Modifying /etc/ld.so.conf[0m

  The runtime manager for shared libraries, [1m/lib/ld.so[22m, gets information
  about the locations and contents of shared libraries from
  /etc/ld.so.cache, a file created by [1mldconfig [22mfrom information in
  /etc/ld.so.conf.  Because MythTV installs some shared libraries in
  /usr/local/lib, that directory needs to be added to the list of
  directories for [1mld.so [22mto search when doing runtime linking of
  programs, if it is not already there.  You do this, as root, by
  editing /etc/ld.so.conf, then running [1mldconfig[22m. There are many ways to
  do this; one that works is to enter this series of commands:



       $ su -
       # echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf
       # /sbin/ldconfig
       # exit
       $



  [1m4.3.  Environment variable Requirements for MythTV[0m

  [1m4.3.1.  General requirements[0m

  [1m4.3.1.1.  QT libraries and binaries[0m

  The compiler needs to be able to locate QT binaries and libraries in
  order to compile MythTV. QTDIR needs to be set and the directory
  holding the QT binaries needs to be added to your PATH.  Your
  distribution may already be making these changes as a part of the
  installation of the software prerequisites detailed earlier.

  One way to do this is as follows:

  Open a shell and execute the following:


       $ echo $PATH
       /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games:/usr/lib/qt3/bin:/home/mythtv/bin:/usr/lib/qt3/bin
       $ echo $QTDIR
       /usr/lib/qt3
       $ which qmake
       /usr/lib/qt3/bin/qmake



  For Mandrake, you should see a value like /usr/lib/qt3 for QTDIR and
  /usr/lib/qt3/bin should be in $PATH.

  For Gentoo, you should see a value like /usr/qt/3 for QTDIR and
  /usr/qt/3/bin should be in $PATH.

  If you don't, do not proceed past this step until you have resolved
  this error. You may need to manually specify the QTDIR and PATH at the
  shell prompt before compiling.

  Also, check that there has been a link created in /usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs
  (/usr/share/qt3/mkspecs for Debian) called default. If not, you'll get
  errors during the compile. See the Troubleshooting Section for more
  information.

  [1m4.3.2.  Distribution-Specific Notes[0m

  [1m4.3.2.1.  Mandrake[0m

  The following instructions work for Mandrake using [1mbash [22mas the shell,
  and may be applicable for a distribution which uses /etc/profile.d.



          [1mNOTE[22m:  Mandrake 10 installs a /etc/profile.d/qtdir3.sh
  file, but it doesn't include the addition of the PATH variable.  If
  you're running Mandrake 10, don't create a mythtv.sh file as detailed
  below; edit the qtdir3.sh file and add the PATH statement within the
  if / fi block.  As root, create the following file in /etc/profile.d
  The example filename is "mythtv.sh". Use what you feel is appropriate.

  Open a shell, and switch to superuser mode.



            [1mNOTE[22m: ^D means press CTRL and d at the same time.


       $ su
       # cd /etc/profile.d
       cat > mythtv.sh
       export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3
       export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/qt3/bin
       ^D

       # chmod a+x mythtv.sh
       # exit
       $ exit



  The last two commands are to exit out of the shell. This way, when you
  next open a shell your new commands will take effect.

  [1m4.3.2.2.  Red Hat Linux 9[0m

  Red Hat Linux 9 use a default locale with UTF-8 encoding.
  Date::Manip, a perl module used by XMLTV, is not UTF-8 safe. As a
  result, whenever you run setup or mythfilldatabase you will get a lot
  of UTF-8 warnings. There is an
  http://membled.com/work/patches/DateManip/
  <http://membled.com/work/patches/DateManip/> updated version of
  Date::Manip at the XMLTV site fixing this and other XMLTV related
  bugs.


  [1m4.3.2.3.  Debian[0m

  Debian source packages are available from the same place as the binary
  packages.  These can be used to build customized packages, and to
  automatically satisfy MythTV's build-time dependencies.

  If building from [1msubversion [22minstead of the source package, then the
  QTDIR environment variable must be set when building.  On Debian
  unstable, QTDIR should be set to /usr/share/qt3.  Edit the
  /etc/profile file using your favorite text editor and add something
  like:


       PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games"
       QTDIR="/usr/share/qt3"
       .
       .
       .
       export PATH QTDIR



  [1m4.3.3.  Device Permissions[0m

  MythTV will need access to the video4linux devices on your system.  By
  default, your distribution may restrict access to these devices to the
  logged-in user, so if you will be automatically starting [1mmythbackend[0m
  from a script rather than an interactive terminal session you will
  need to make some adjustments.

  [1mNOTE[22m: The following instructions are accurate for Mandrake.

  Check for a file called /etc/security/console.perms.  Open the file in
  your favorite text editor and look for a line that has:


       <console>  0600 <v4l>        0600 root.video



  and replace it with


       <console>  0666 <v4l>        0666 root.video



  What we're doing is allowing read and write access to the files in the
  video4linux directory.

  [1m5.  Downloading and compiling.[0m

  Get MythTV from the mythtv.org <http://www.mythtv.org> web site.
  There are two installation methods you may choose from.  The first is
  to download the latest release in tarball format and compile.  The
  tarball release of MythTV should work on a wide variety of systems and
  should be the preferred method for new users.  If you wish to use the
  [1msubversion [22mcopy of MythTV you may obtain it from http://cvs.mythtv.org
  <http://cvs.mythtv.org>



        [1mNOTE[22m: If you are going to use [1msubversion [22mto compile MythTV
  rather than using the distribution tarball, it is [1mstrongly [22mrecommended
  that you join the http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-
  commits/ <http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-commits/> and
  http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-dev/
  <http://www.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-dev/> mailing lists.

  [1m5.3.  Configuring the Zap2It.com DataDirect service[0m

  Zap2It DataDirect is a service provided by Zap2It, a subsidiary of
  Tribune Media Services.  TMS is one of the primary providers for
  program listing data in the United States and Canada.  There are a
  number of advantages to using DataDirect rather than the standard
  XMLTV tv_grab_na grabber.


  +o  The tv_grab_na grabber is no longer supported and will not be fixed
     when problems occur.

  +o  It's much faster, because the grabber isn't downloading hundreds of
     HTML pages and trying to parse the program data out of the HTML.

  +o  It contains more program information.

  +o  It's easier on the Zap2It servers, since they're not generating
     hundreds of custom HTML pages when you scrape their listings.

  +o  The service is available free of charge by periodically filling in
     surveys similar to the one presented during registration, and the
     data provider has no intention of charging for it in the future.

  If you wish to use Zap2It DataDirect, you'll need to establish a user
  account.  Go to http://labs.zap2it.com <http://labs.zap2it.com> and
  click on the "New User? Sign Up" link.  Read the license terms, and if
  you agree with them click "Accept".  The next screen is the
  subscription registration.  In the "Certificate Code" field, enter
  [1mZIYN-DQZO-SBUT[22m.

  Fill in the survey, then proceed to the lineup choices and configure
  your account for your particular location and the channels that you
  have.  This configuration will be imported into MythTV when you first
  run the [1msetup [22mprogram.

  See the section called ``Migrating from XMLTV to DataDirect'' for
  instructions on moving to DataDirect if you are currently using XMLTV.
  If you are starting from a fresh installation, the simplest thing is
  to immediately start using DataDirect.


  [1m5.4.  Manually building MythTV[0m

  Unpack MythTV



  $ tar -xjf mythtv-0.18.1.tar.bz2
  $ cd mythtv-0.18.1
  $ ./configure



  As of MythTV version 0.18, there is no need to edit the settings.pro
  file to set compile-time options.  The [1mconfigure [22mscript will configure
  MythTV appropriately for your system.  If you wish to change options,
  run [1m./configure --help [22mto see what is available and to override and
  automatically detected options.  See the config.log file after running
  [1mconfigure [22mto see previous runs.

  On a single CPU machine, you would type the following to compile
  MythTV:


       $ qmake mythtv.pro
       $ make



  If you want to build MythTV on a multi-CPU machine (or with [1mdistcc[22m),
  specify "-j numjobs".  In the following example, we will have two
  concurrent jobs executing.  Do not set the number of jobs too high, or
  your compile will actually take longer to complete than it would if
  you did a "normal" build.


       $ qmake mythtv.pro
       $ make qmake
       $ make -j 2



  If you are using [1mdistcc[22m, and you had two other host machines (red,
  blue) participating, you would do something like:


       $ export DISTCC_HOSTS='localhost red blue'
       $ qmake mythtv.pro
       $ make qmake
       $ make -j 6 CXX=distcc



  The actual speed-up, if any, is dependant on a number of factors, such
  as number of CPUs / hosts, etc.  The [1mdistcc [22mdocumentation recommends
  using a -j value of twice the number of CPUs available to keep all of
  them busy.

  Some timing information.  The following should only be used for
  illustration; your actual results may vary.  The test involves a
  complete make distclean to the final binary.

  +o  P4 3.2Ghz HT: "standard" make: 12m 49s

  +o  P4 3.2Ghz HT: make -j 2: 11m 24s

  In the above example, we see that with a single CPU, a multi-stage
  [1mmake [22mdoes not significantly decrease compile time.

  Once the compile is done, switch to superuser:


       $ su
       # make install
       # exit



     [1mNOTE[22m:  subsequent configuration steps assume that you are within
  the MythTV directory that you cd'd to above.

  [1m5.4.1.  Enabling real-time scheduling of the display thread.[0m

  MythTV supports real-time scheduling of the video output thread if it
  is installed SUID root.

  This is an optional, but recommended step, if you understand the
  potential negative impact.  As a positive, It can make the video
  display more smoothly, especially if you are decoding HDTV.



    [1mNOTE[22m: Please note that this opens a security hole in your system.

  If the tradeoff is acceptable:



       $ su
       # chmod a+s /usr/local/bin/mythfrontend
       # exit
       $



  [1mNOTE[22m:  Making this change will affect your ability to run [1mmythfrontend[0m
  within [1mgdb [22mfor debugging purposes.  If you need to debug, you will
  need to run as root.


  [1m5.4.2.  Frontend-only configuration[0m

  Since MythTV uses a client/server architecture, multiple frontend
  computers can simultaneously access content on a Myth system.  Live
  TV, watching and scheduling recordings, etc. are all possible from
  multiple frontends.

  To get a better picture of what is needed to run a frontend, note the
  following:

  You do NOT need the MySQL server installed on your remote frontend

  You do NOT need XMLTV installed on your remote frontend


  You do NOT need to run the MythTV setup program on your frontend
  machine

  Other than the exclusion of the MySQL server and XMLTV, the MythTV
  compilation procedure is the same as when you're setting up both a
  backend and a frontend.  However, you [4mwill[24m need to install the
  database access libraries.

  Once MythTV is compiled and installed:

  Run the MythTV setup program on your Master backend. Under the
  "General" menu, change the IP address of the current machine (by
  default, "127.0.0.1") to the real external IP address - 127.0.0.1 is
  the loopback address and no external machine can access it. Change the
  Master Server IP setting to the same IP address as well.

  Run the mythfrontend program on your frontend machine, and a "Database
  Configuration" screen should appear.  Set the "Host name" field to
  point to your Master backend's IP address.

  This step is only required on the system maintaining the database,

  tions for doing so can be found on MySQL's web site at
  http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Security.html <http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Security.html>.

  [1m6.2.4.  Modifying access to the MySQL database for multiple systems[0m

  If you're going to have multiple systems accessing a master database,
  you must grant access to the database from remote systems.  By
  default, the mc.sql script is only granting access to the local host.

  To allow other hosts access to your master database, you can either
  set it up for no security at all, or with more granularity.  Note that
  the "%" is the wildcard character in MySQL.



         [1mNOTE[22m:  The "no security" option is [4mvery[24m dangerous unless
  you're in a controlled environment.  This example has no security at
  all, and allows access from any host.


       $ mysql -u root mythconverg
       mysql> grant all on mythconverg.* to mythtv@"%" identified by "mythtv";
       mysql> flush privileges;



  For a more secure setup, you can restrict which machines or subnets
  have access. If you have a complete DNS system operational, you could
  do the following:


       $ mysql -u root mythconverg
       mysql> grant all on mythconverg.* to mythtv@"%.mydomain.com" identified by "mythtv";
       mysql> flush privileges;



  Finally, if you just want to restrict by IP subnet:


       $ mysql -u root mythconverg
       mysql> grant all on mythconverg.* to mythtv@"192.168.1.%" identified by "mythtv";
       mysql> flush privileges;


  [1m7.  Configuring Sound.[0m

  If your video doesn't appear to be in-sync with your audio, it could
  be because you are listening to the real-time audio from your video
  card rather than after it's been processed and synchronized to the
  video by MythTV.  Because MythTV is a personal video recorder, "Live
  TV" isn't really live - to let you pause live TV, MythTV is actually
  encoding the video, saving to disk, and then playing it back.  This
  procedure puts your MythTV "live" TV about 2 seconds behind real-time,
  so it's important that you're not listening to the live audio.
  However, if you're having an issue where the audio and video aren't
  synchronized by small but varying amount, it's most likely because the
  sound driver that you're using doesn't have the DSP_CAP_REALTIME
  capability.  This was the case with ALSA (0.5), but not with newer
  versions (0.9).  See the ``Troubleshooting Audio'' section for more
  information if you're having issues with sound.  Also, ensure that no
  other programs are grabbing the audio output, like [1marts [22mor [1mesd[22m.

  What you need to do is to mute the "line-in" of your sound card and
  also set it as the recording source.

  There are two ways to do this.  Graphically, and from the command
  line.


  [1m7.1.  Graphically setting up the mixer[0m

  [1m7.1.1.  Mandrake and Red Hat Linux/Fedora Core[0m

  Open Kmix by clicking K->Multimedia->Sound->Kmix for Mandrake, or

  RedHat Menu>Sound & Video>Volume Control



  Click on Settings->Configure  Make sure that "Tick Marks" and "Show
  labels" have "X"'s in them.  This will make it easier to find the
  correct audio source.  Click OK.

  On the mixer page, look for Line-In on your sound card.  You should
  see two LED's - a green one at the top, and a red one at the bottom.
  The green one at the top is for muting; you want to make sure that the
  green LED is a dark green, meaning that it's "off".  You also want to
  click on the red LED so that it turns bright red, indicating that it's
  "ON"; this insures that the Line-in is used as the source.  Click OK,
  and make sure that you save the settings so that this is your default.


  [1m7.1.1.1.  Using OSS drivers.[0m

  Red Hat Linux and Fedora Core 1 ship with OSS sound drivers rather
  than the ALSA drivers recommended by the MythTV team. The OSS drivers
  do work for many people, and for many cards. We recommend that you
  give OSS a try since it is already included in the vendor
  distribution. However, some people report problems (sync and jitter)
  with OSS, and in addition it does not support full-duplex on some
  cards.  Full duplex is required if you want to record and play sound
  using just one sound card. ALSA has good full-duplex support, and also
  has drivers for some built-in (motherboard) sound cards that OSS does
  not.  Installing ALSA is less painful than you might think, so if OSS
  does not work for you, installing ALSA is not too difficult. For those
  of you who do not wish to install ALSA you must do this:

  To configure sound to work with MythTV, select


  RedHat Menu>Sound &
  Video>Volume Control


  (on the far left) is up. Also make sure that the "line in" section has
  "mute" and "record" checked and that the gain is turned up. You may
  have to experiment with volume/gain levels to get the best sound.


  [1m7.1.1.2.  Using ALSA.[0m

  If you'd like to use ALSA, you'll need to correctly setup your
  asoundrc file. Configuring this file is beyond the scope of this
  HOWTO.  Once ALSA is working correctly, change the output sound device
  in mythfrontend->setup->Audio from /dev/dsp to ALSA:default.  This
  field may be edited to suit your ALSA requirements.


  [1m7.2.  Setting the mixer from the command line[0m

  If you have installed the alsa-utils package, then the [1mamixer [22mprogram
  can be used to setup the mixer.  The "Master" volume setting is only
  required on a frontend machine to ensure that the sound channels are
  unmuted and configured for outputting sound.  The "Line" and "Capture"
  controls are required for your sound card to actually capture audio
  from the external Line-in.  Not all sound cards have a "Capture"
  control, but if yours does and you don't set it then MythTV will not
  capture audio.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  Note the spelling in the following commands.
  ______________________________________________________________________



       $ amixer set Master,0 100%,100% unmute
       $ amixer set PCM,0 100%,100% unmute
       $ amixer set Line,0 75%,75% mute captur
       $ amixer set Capture,0 100%,100% captur
       $ su
       # alsactl store
       # exit
       $



  If you have multiple sound cards, then use the -c parameter to specify
  which card to adjust.  Note that the first card will be "0", the
  second will be "1", etc.

  That takes care of setting the volume correctly, and the ALSA startup
  script will restore the volume after a reboot.  If you find that your
  sound is distorted, it's possible that the levels in the above
  examples are too high for your particular hardware combination.  Try
  reducing the percentages by 5-10% and checking again.  Once you're
  satisfied, re-run the alsactl store command.

  You may also use the [1malsamixer [22mprogram to set the volume. If you are
  using an ALSA version after 1.0.6, use [1malsamixer -V all [22m. First, start
  [1malsamixer [22mfrom the command line.  You should start out on the "Master"
  volume control slider.  Use the up and down cursor to set the master
  volume to around 75%.  Next, use the left and right cursor keys to
  move around on the screen until you find the "Line" slider.  Press
  SPACE to set it as the capture source, set the level to around 50-75%
  and press "M" to mute it.  You can now press ESC to exit out of the
  [1malsamixer [22mprogram.  You can also have MythTV manage all volume and
  mute settings, but this will only affect the "Master" or PCM volume,
  not the capture volume.  See the mythfrontend setup page for options.


  [1m8.  Setting up a remote control.[0m

  MythTV does not have native remote control receiver and decoder
  software built-in.  Instead, remote control functions are implemented
  by cooperating with [1mlirc[22m, the Linux Infrared Remote Control program.
  [1mlirc [22mhandles the IR hardware and passes keystrokes to MythTV, which
  then acts as if the user had pressed the keys on the keyboard.  The
  file keys.txt describes the keys used to control MythTV.



            [1mNOTE[22m: If you are running Mandrake, you may install
  [1mlirc [22mby executing: # urpmi lirc lirc-remotes and bypass the manual
  compilation steps described below by jumping to the ``Completing the
  lirc install'' section. See the contrib/mandrake91.etc.sysconfig.lircd
  file for an example of how to configure lircd.

  Some IR devices require a kernel recompile, and some don't. However,
  all at least require having the kernel source available as a resource
  for the lirc build process.


  [1m8.1.  Gentoo[0m

  To install lirc on Gentoo, all you need to do is:


       # emerge lirc



  [1m8.2.  Mandrake[0m

  lircd has two prerequisites:  [1mdialog[22m, available in Mandrake through
  the "cdialog" RPM, and the kernel source.  Mandrake 9.0 is using the
  2.4.19 kernel, so either install the kernel sources from the
  installation CD or go to http://www.kernel.org <http://www.kernel.org>
  and download the full 2.4.19 tar file from
  http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/
  <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/>.


  [1m8.2.1.  Obtaining the kernel[0m

  Install using urpmi.


       $ su
       # urpmi kernel-source



  [1m8.3.  Red Hat Linux/Fedora Core[0m

  You should already have the source from the "Kernel Development"
  package you installed in section 3.2. Ensure that a symlink has been
  created:


       $ cd /usr/src
       $ su
       # ln -s linux-2.4 /usr/src/linux
       # exit



  [1m8.4.  Obtaining and compiling lirc[0m

  You're going to need to download and compile [1mlircd[22m.  Go to
  http://www.lirc.org <http://www.lirc.org> and download lirc; as of
  2005-05-17, the version available is 0.7.1.  Grab the remotes.tgz file
  as well.


       $ tar -xjf lirc-0.7.1.tar.bz2
       $ cd lirc-0.7.1
       $ ./setup.sh



  You're going to need to know what sort of receiver you have and where
  it's connected.  In the case of the Pinnacle Studio TV card, with the
  IR receiver connected to COM1 (/dev/ttys0), once the configuration
  menu comes up, perform the configuration by going to Driver Configura-
  tion->Other Serial Port Devices->Pinnacle Systems Receiver->OK and on
  the next page select COM1->OK.

  Each remote is different; some remote receivers connect directly to
  your capture card and not to a serial port, so make sure that you've
  got the correct one.

  You then click "Save Configuration and run configure" to continue.

  Make sure you read the last text generated by the configure step. It
  will tell you if you require a kernel recompile, and what the name of
  your kernel module will be (if necessary). For instance a home-built
  receiver may require a kernel recompile, so you would be notified that
  you will have to load the lirc_serial module. If you did not get any
  such messages skip the kernel recompile steps below and go directly to
  making and installing the lirc driver.

  Once the configuration step is complete:


       $ make
       $ su
       # make install
       # chmod 666 /dev/lircd



  At this point, if you're using a serial receiver, check that there's a
  lirc device in /dev:

  $ ls -l /dev/li*
  lr-xr-xr-x    1 root     root            5 Jan 27 09:00 /dev/lirc -> ttyS0
  srw-rw-rw-    1 root     root            0 Jan 27 15:01 /dev/lircd=
  prw-r--r--    1 root     root            0 Jan 27 09:00 /dev/lircm|



  As you can see, there's a link from /dev/lirc to ttyS0, a.k.a. "COM1",
  which is appropriate for the Pinnacle Systems PCTV Pro.  However, you
  may notice something like this:


       crw-------    1 root     root      61,   0 Dec 31  1969 lirc



  Some IR receivers (including some homebrew units) use a character
  device as their data interface as opposed to a link to a serial port.
  If the make install step has created a character device for you, don't
  replace it with a link to a COM port.

  So, if the link or character device was not created (but should have
  been), ensure that you ran the make install step as root.  If it still
  doesn't work, then there are three options.  The first option is to
  re-read the [1mlirc [22mdocumentation to determine whether your IR receiver
  is a character device or should be a link to a serial port and to
  create the link/character device manually.  In this example, the IR
  device is connected to ttyS0.  If it were connected to "COM2", then
  use ttyS1, etc.


       $ su
       # cd /dev
       # ln -sf ttyS0 lirc
       # exit
       $



       [1mNOTE[22m:  The above example assumes that your receiver uses the
  standard serial driver.  Some receivers do not, including receivers
  that plug into a TV capture card.  Check the lirc documentation, but
  it may be necessary to replace the link created above with a character
  pipe:


       # mknod /dev/lirc c 61 0



  See the lirc documentation for additional information.  The lirc
  installation [4mshould[24m create this for you, so manually creating it
  indicates that your lirc installation may have other issues.

  The second option is to post your issue to the [4mlirc[24m list, not the
  mythtv-users list.  The lirc programmers will be the ones that can
  assist you best.
  The third option is to dispense with lirc altogether by purchasing an
  IR keyboard (various options exist, although Chicony appears to work
  for some people) and a learning remote control.  The IR keyboard
  receiver plugs into the PS/2 keyboard port on your PC and you would
  train your learning remote to emulate the various keystrokes from
  keys.txt of your IR keyboard.  Using this method removes lirc entirely
  from the picture - your remote will be sending keypresses that your PC
  "sees" on the keyboard port.


  [1m8.5.  Completing the lirc install[0m



      [1mNOTE to Mandrake 9.1 users[22m: skip to the manual start paragraph
  below.

  If the lirc configure program / compile did not mention anything about
  a kernel module, then you are finished. If it did mention a kernel
  module, you must edit the /etc/modules.conf file. Add this line as the
  first thing in the file.  It must come first, or it may not work.


       alias char-major-61 XXX



  replace XXX with the name which you determined earlier, which in this
  example was "lirc_serial"


       $ su
       # modprobe lirc_serial
       # /sbin/ldconfig



  Next, we're going to manually start lircd the first time.  Mandrake
  9.1 users, type: # /etc/rc.d/init.d/lircd start instead of:


       # /usr/local/sbin/lircd



  If this fails, complaining of a missing lircd.conf file, then you must
  find or make one. First look for a pre-made configuration file at
  http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/
  <http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/>.  Mandrake 9.1 users, look in
  /usr/share/lirc-remotes. If you find one your remotes either on the
  website or in /usr/share, download or copy the file, name it
  lircd.conf and put it in your /etc directory. If you couldn't find
  your remote, you must make your own lircd.conf file.

  To make your own lircd.conf file


       $ irrecord myremote


  Follow the on-screen directions to train your remote and define keys.
  If your remote ends up working well, you should consider submitting
  your lircd.conf file back to the lirc developers. Once finished:


       $ su
       # cp myremote /etc/lircd.conf



  now try to start lircd again:


       # /usr/local/sbin/lircd



  Now, we're going to add the commands necessary for lircd to run each
  time we boot. Mandrake 9.1 users, you can execute:


       $ su
       # chkconfig --level 35 lircd on
       # exit



  All other distributions:


       # cd /etc/rc.d
       # cat >> rc.local
       echo "Starting lircd"
       /usr/local/sbin/lircd
       ^D
       # exit
       $



  This takes care of the lircd portion, which "listens" for the IR
  signals. If everything went well, the install script for lircd put an
  appropriate configuration file for your remote into /etc/lircd.conf
  This file maps the buttons on the remote control to the IR pulses
  coming from the receiver.

  The next step is to convert those signals into something that can be
  used to control MythTV.  MythTV now includes native support for lirc
  and can interact directly with



       $ cd ~/mythtv-0.18.1/configfiles
       $ cp lircrc.example ~/.lircrc



  or


  $ cp lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv ~/.lircrc



  if you've got a Pinnacle Studio PCTV remote.


       $ irw



  Start pressing the keys on your remote; [1mirw [22mwill print the name of the
  button as it is defined in your /etc/lircd.conf. If you don't see any-
  thing at this point, you need to troubleshoot further by going back to
  the lirc home page and investigating from there.

  If it is working, then press [1mCTRL-C [22mto abort the program.  Once you
  know that your remote is working, you can either recompile MythTV with
  native lirc support by enabling it in [1mconfigure [22mor you need to run the
  [1mirxevent [22mprogram, which takes the key presses and sends them to
  MythTV.  If you use native lirc support, you don't need to run
  [1mirxevent[22m.  If you are going to use irxevent, then you need to run it
  like this:


       $ irxevent &



  If [1mirxevent [22misn't running, then MythTV will not respond to your remote
  control unless you're using native lirc support.


  [1m8.6.  Additional information for lirc[0m

  Take a look at the lircrc.example files in the configfiles/ directory.
  In my case, (Pinnacle Studio card) the channel up and down functions
  weren't working, due to the fact that the button names were different
  than the default lircrc.example file that came with MythTV.

  The lircrc.example file has this:


       begin
           prog = irxevent
           button = ChannelUp
           config = Key Up CurrentWindow
       end

       begin
           prog = irxevent
           button = ChannelDown
           config = Key Down CurrentWindow
       end



  but the /etc/lircd.conf that comes in the lircd package defines the
  buttons for the Pinnacle Studio PCTV as:



            channel+                 0x0000000000000017
            channel-                 0x000000000000001C



  rather than "ChannelUp" and "ChannelDown".  I added the following to
  my /home/[yourusername]/.lircrc file:


       begin
           prog = irxevent
           button = channel+
           repeat = 3
           config = Key Up CurrentWindow
       end

       begin
           prog = irxevent
           button = channel-
           repeat = 3
           config = Key Down CurrentWindow
       end



  which took care of basic functionality.  Because the PCTV Studio
  remote has additional buttons, look at the configfiles/lircrc.exam-
  ple.pinnaclestudiopctv for an example of how to define additional but-
  tons, and how to debug potential button name conflicts between the
  lircrc.example file and how [1myour [22mremote defines the button names.

  By examining the button names defined in /etc/lircd.conf and using the
  [1mirw [22mprogram to make sure that your remote is working, you can create
  the appropriate mappings in .lircrc to get excellent remote
  functionality with MythTV.

  Note the [1mrepeat = [22mparameter.  This informs the irxevent program to
  pass through every third keypress.  By default, lirc will only send
  one keypress to the application, even if you're holding down the key.
  The actual [1mrepeat = [22mnumber will vary from system to system, so
  experiment and see which value works best for you.


  [1m8.7.  Configuring lirc for use with an IR blaster[0m

  Lirc has support for various IR transmitters. A popular model is the
  Actisys IR-200L http://store.snapstreamstore.com/accessories.html
  <http://store.snapstreamstore.com/accessories.html>. It was originally
  designed for IRDA communication, but can be used to transmit A/V
  remote control codes. By using the lirc SIR driver, this device can
  easily be integrated with MythTV. I have tested this device with an
  AT&T DCT2000 digital cable box but the instructions can be used to
  configure other IRDA devices and A/V remotes.

  Follow the steps in the previous section.  When you run setup.sh,
  select option 1, driver configuration. From here select option 6, IrDA
  hardware.  Select your appropriate device and the corresponding serial
  port, then Save configuration & run configure from the main menu. Once
  configure is done type:


       $ make


  Please note: unlike the Pinnacle receiver above you will be compiling
  lircd in addition to a kernel module for the SIR transmitter.
  Depending on whether you have your serial port driver configured as a
  kernel module you might see the following message during make:


       lirc_sir.c:56:2: warning: #warning
       "******************************************"

       lirc_sir.c:57:2: warning: #warning "Your serial port driver is compiled into "

       lirc_sir.c:58:2: warning: #warning "the kernel. You will have to release the "

       lirc_sir.c:59:2: warning: #warning "port you want to use for LIRC with:"

       lirc_sir.c:60:2: warning: #warning "setserial /dev/ttySx uart none"

       lirc_sir.c:61:2: warning: #warning
       "******************************************"



  If you do receive this statement make sure to run the [1msetserial[0m
  command before you load the lirc_sir module. Follow this with the
  install:


       $ su
       # make install



  You will notice that lirc installs the kernel module in
  /lib/modules/uname -a/misc.

  The configuration for starting [1mlircd [22mdiffers if you're going to be
  sending and receiving IR versus just receiving.



       # cd /etc/rc.d
       # cat >> rc.local
       echo "Starting lircd"
       setserial /dev/ttySx uart none        # (if required)
       modprobe lirc_sir
       /usr/local/sbin/lircd
       ^D
       # exit
       $



  At this point you have to populate the /etc/lircd.conf file with the
  proper codes for your A/V remote. You should be able to find your
  remote within the lirc remote tar file located at
  http://www.lirc.org/remotes.tar.bz2
  <http://www.lirc.org/remotes.tar.bz2>. In my case I extracted the file
  from remotes/motorola/DCT2000 (gi-motorola-dct2000)

  To test the lirc_sir module you can run [1mirw [22mto verify the codes are
  being received. If everything is configured correctly you should see
  something similar to the following:

  $ irw
  0000000000007ff0 00 1 gi-motorola-dct2000
  000000000000bff8 00 2 gi-motorola-dct2000
  000000000000f7f0 00 ENTER gi-motorola-dct2000



  Once you've verified lirc is working you can press [1mCTRL-C [22mto exit [1mirw[0m
  and configure the channel changing script.

  The path to the channel changing script will need to be entered on the
  mythbackend setup screen for Input Connections.

  This csh script will be called each time MythTV needs to change the
  channel.  Below is a copy of the script followed by the corresponding
  perl script.  Make sure both are in your path. Also make sure you
  leave the #!/bin/csh setting and not change it to Bourne or bash. This
  will create a frustrating symptom to diagnose where MythTV cannot open
  /dev/device. Unlike Bourne or bash, csh scripts automatically close
  parent file descriptors before they start.


       $ cd /usr/local/bin
       # su
       # cat > change_channel.csh
       #!/bin/csh
       echo "changing to $1"
       /usr/local/bin/channel.pl $1 &
       ^D
       # chmod a+x change_channel.csh
       # exit
       $ exit



  See contrib/channel.pl for the actual file.  Copy it to
  /usr/local/bin/

  The last statement within the perl script is the lirc rc command. This
  is the command that transmits the code to your cable/DSS box. Make
  sure to have the IRDA device within a few feet of the box.


  [1m9.  Configuring MythTV.[0m

  By this point, all of the compile-time prerequisites have been
  installed, [1mmysql [22mis running and has had its initial database setup.
  It's now time to configure MythTV.



      [1mNOTE[22m:  If you're running Debian unstable and you have compiled
  MythTV from source, you will need to install an additional package
  before you will be able to run MythTV.  Execute the following to
  install the MySQL driver for QT.


       $ su -
       # apt-get install libqt3c102-mt-mysql
       # exit

  [1m9.1.  Configuring the Master backend system[0m

  Open a shell and decide where you will store your video files.  By
  default, MythTV will assume that you will be using /mnt/store/, but if
  this directory doesn't exist, or it exists and you don't have write
  privileges to it then MythTV will fail when you attempt to make a
  recording.  The following example is specific for /var/video, but the
  same instructions would apply if you want to keep the default but
  don't have the directory structure setup yet.  See the ``Advanced
  Partition Formatting'' section for hints on creating a partition for
  MythTV.

  If you create a /var/video subdirectory, change /mnt/store/ to
  /var/video/ in the setup screens.


       $ su
       # mkdir /var/video
       # chmod a+rwx /var/video
       # exit



  [1mNOTE[22m:  The last slash "/" is not required.

  The first thing to configure is the Master backend system.  If you are
  running multiple backend systems, the Master backend will make all
  decisions about which programs will be recorded on which tuners.  If
  you have only one backend, then it will be its own master.

  The Master backend will always choose the first available tuner in the
  same order as you add cards through "setup". In other words, the
  second card you add will only be used when there are two overlapping
  recordings, the third when there are three, and so on. Therefore, you
  will want to have the greatest amount of disk space on the Master
  backend because its tuner will always be the first choice. You will
  then want to add your ``other backends'' in the order of your
  preference for recording.



        [1mNOTE[22m:  It is possible to [4mnot[24m have the cards on the Master
  backend be the first ones used.  However, if you are new to MythTV it
  is easier to configure the Master backend first before moving on to
  the Slaves, at least until you become more familiar with the MythTV
  system.  See ``Advanced Backend Configurations'' for information on
  configuring multiple backend systems in various ways.

  Because MythTV now uses a database to store all configuration
  variables, part of the bootstrap of MythTV is to indicate the location
  of the MySQL database server. If the frontend, backend and MySQL
  database server are all going to be running on the same box, you can
  continue to the next step.  If not, you'll need to change the Host
  Name in the "Database Configuration" screen of the mythfrontend
  program.



   [1mNOTE[22m:  Users that have been running the frontend and the backend on
  different machines have stated that they have been having issues with
  remote access to the MySQL database.  The following instructions may
  or may not work.  Add the following to /etc/my.cnf on the backend
  machine and restart MySQL.


       skip-innodb
       set-variable=thread_stack=256k



  Run the setup program:


       $ mythtv-setup



  The backend setup program will start and offer you a number of
  choices.  It is [4mstrongly[24m recommended that you go through them in
  order.

  The first question will ask if you wish to clear out your existing
  configurations for your capture cards.  Initially, you should say
  "YES" so that there are no surprises later.

  The next question will ask you if you wish to clear out your video
  source information.  You should answer "YES" to this as well.

  Once the graphical setup starts, you'll see that there are five
  choices.

  1. General

  2. Capture Cards

  3. Video Sources

  4. Input Connections

  5. Channel Editor

  Use the arrow keys to move around, and press the space bar to select
  which option you wish to configure.


  [1m9.1.1.  General[0m

  The first screen of the General configuration deals with IP addresses
  of the system that you're running setup on and any master backend you
  may have.  If you've only got one machine, then the default values are
  fine and you can move to the next page by pressing the space bar.  If
  you need to move around the screen, use the arrow keys to move focus
  between settings, not the mouse.

  If you will be deploying multiple backends, or if your backend is on
  one system and you're running the frontend on another machine then [4mdo[0m
  [4mnot[24m use the "127.0.0.1" IP address.

  [1mNOTE[22m: If you modify the 127.0.0.1 address and use a "real" IP address,
  you must use real IP addresses in both fields, otherwise your frontend
  machines will generate "Unexpected response to MYTH_PROTO_VERSION"
  errors.

  It is very strongly discouraged that you make any changes to the port
  settings from the defaults.

  Once you're satisfied with the values, move the focus down to Next and
  hit the space bar.

  The next screen details the Host-specific Backend setup.  This is
  where you will set the specific directory paths for this particular
  backend.  Make sure that you've followed the steps at the beginning of
  this section and created a directory that exists and that MythTV will
  have write privileges to.  When you're done, press Next to continue,
  taking you to the Global Backend Setup.

  On the Global Backend Setup configure your backend with the
  appropriate settings.  Use the left and right arrow keys to iterate
  through the choices available on each setting, and the up and down
  keys to move between settings.  Move to Finish when you're done and
  press the space bar, taking you back to the main configuration screen.


  [1m9.1.2.  Capture Cards[0m

  You should have no capture cards defined, so the highlight will be on
  (New Capture Card).  Press space to begin.

  Choose the appropriate settings for your particular tuner.  Use the
  arrow keys to move around and to make your choices, and press RETURN
  when complete.  Pressing RETURN will take you back to the Capture
  Cards screen; if you have additional capture cards in this machine,
  press the space bar when the highlight is on the (New Capture Card)
  row to define another card.

  If you have made a mistake, you can delete a card by highlighting it
  and pressing the 'D' key, or you can highlight it and press the RETURN
  or 'E' key to edit it.

  Once you have no additional cards to setup, press ESC.


  [1m9.1.3.  Video Sources[0m

  When you start, the highlight should be on (New Video Source).  Press
  the space bar to begin.  The first field asks for the name of the
  video source.  You may choose something easy to remember, like
  "Antenna" or "Cable".  Once you've chosen a name, press the down arrow
  to move to the next field.

  If you're in North America, change the grabber to "DataDirect", then
  continue pressing the down arrow to move to the next field.  Fill in
  the username and password that you have established with DataDirect,
  then move to the "Retrieve Listings" button and press the space bar.

  [1mNOTE[22m: You need [1mwget [22mversion 1.9.1 or higher to use DataDirect.

  The setup program will contact the Zap2It servers and get your account
  information.  Once you're done, you may click the Finish button and
  skip the next few paragraphs in this document since they only apply to
  users that are using the external XMLTV script to get their guide
  data.

  If you wish to continue using the XMLTV grabber, then move to the
  Zip/postal code field and put in the appropriate value.

  If you're outside of North America, then some manual interaction will
  be required with XMLTV.

  Once you have chosen your provider, press RETURN to continue.  XMLTV
  will now begin collecting the initial data for your location.  The
  screen may blank for a few seconds to several minutes, depending on
  the load of the listings provider and the speed of your connection to
  the Internet.  Be patient!

  You will then be returned to the Video Sources screen.  If you have
  multiple video sources available, such as Antenna, Cable, etc, go
  ahead and define them all, even if they're not all going to be
  physically connected to the master backend server.  Once you're done,
  press ESC to return to the main screen.


  [1m9.1.4.  Input Connections[0m

  The final configuration item is Input Connections.  On this screen,
  you will associate the various video sources you defined earlier with
  a physical input to a encoder card.  It's entirely possible that you
  have multiple tuners, and each tuner has a different input, so on this
  screen you let MythTV know which device will connect to which input
  source.

  When you start this screen, you should see a listing of the various
  input connections available on each of the Capture cards you defined
  earlier.  For example, you may have a capture card with a tuner, a
  SVideo and a Composite connection.  If you wanted to associate the
  tuner (a.k.a., "Television") with an "Antenna" source you defined in
  Video Sources, you would move to the /dev/videodevice (Television) ->
  line and press the space bar.  Using the left and right arrow keys
  will show you the various choices you have already created for video
  source.  In our case, you would use the left/right cursor keys until
  "Antenna" was shown in the Video Source field.  Press down to move to
  the next setting, all of which should be self-explanatory.

  If you have multiple input connection types (Such as Tuner 0 and Tuner
  1), it's very, very likely that it is the lowest numbered input that
  is actually available on the device.



        [1mNOTE[22m:  If you have a Hauppauge PVR-500, you must think of
  it has two PVR-150's on a single PCI card.  For example, if you have a
  single PVR-500 card, it will appear as /dev/video0 and /dev/video1.
  Each /dev/video device will have a Tuner 0 and Tuner 1 input, so you
  would choose Tuner 0 for [1mboth [22mdevices.


  Once you're done, press RETURN to go back to the Input Connections
  screen.  You would then finish associating the video sources to any
  other hardware devices you have available.



     [1mNOTE[22m:  Don't add a video source to a hardware input if you don't
  actually have anything connected there.  For example, adding "Cable"
  to the Tuner and to the Composite inputs without having something
  connected to Composite will lead to blank recordings.

  Press ESC to return to the main menu, and press ESC again if you have
  no further items to configure, thereby returning you to the command
  line.


  [1m9.1.5.  Channel Editor[0m

  The channel editor is used to globally alter channel information,
  including items like hue, contrast, fine tuning and others.  Users in
  North America shouldn't run the channel editor until after completing
  initial setup and running [1mmythfilldatabase [22mat least once to populate
  the database.


  [1m9.2.  Post-configuration[0m

  Run the mythfilldatabase program as directed.  The master backend will
  obtain guide data for all the video sources you defined during setup.

  [1mNOTE[22m: If you are using DataDirect and watching the output messages on
  the console or the log file it is normal to see a "401 Unauthorized"
  error followed by a "200 OK" when the connection to Zap2It is being
  established.

  Once mythfilldatabase has finished, start the master server before
  continuing.


       $ mythbackend



  mythbackend will print information about connections and what it's
  doing to the console.  If you'd like to see the options that are
  available for mythbackend, type mythbackend -h for help.

  As of MythTV v0.18.1, the available options are:



  $ mythbackend --help
  Valid options are:
  -h or --help                   List valid command line parameters
  -l or --logfile filename       Writes STDERR and STDOUT messages to filename
  -p or --pidfile filename       Write PID of mythbackend to filename
  -d or --daemon                 Runs mythbackend as a daemon
  -v or --verbose debug-level    Prints more information
                                 Accepts any combination (separated by comma)
                                 of all,none,quiet,record,playback,channel,
                                 osd,file,schedule,network,commflag,audio,
                                 libav,jobqueue
  --printexpire                  List of auto-expire programs
  --printsched                   Upcoming scheduled programs
  --testsched                    Test run scheduler (ignore existing schedule)
  --resched                      Force the scheduler to update
  --nosched                      Do not perform any scheduling
  --version                      Version information



  Running mythbackend as a daemon and using the logfile option will
  allow you to have mythbackend automatically start up during the boot
  process.  For example, you may add this to your rc.local file, or you
  can follow the steps outlined in the section called ``Automatically
  starting mythbackend at system boot time''.


  [1m9.3.  Configuring a non-master backend[0m

  Ensure that you've granted access to the master MySQL database for
  remote backends as discussed in the section titled ``Modifying access
  to the MySQL database for multiple systems'' and that you have the
  correct IP address for the database server in the "Database
  Configuration" screen of the setup application on this slave backend.

  Make sure that the IP addresses on the General setup screen are
  accurate.  If the slave backend can't communicate with the master
  backend due to IP address misconfiguration then MythTV will not
  function properly.

  Configuration of a non-master backend follows the same general
  procedure as that of the master backend, with the exception that you
  skip over the "Video Sources" step.  All possible video sources need
  to be defined on the master backend system; only the master backend
  will query a listings provider to obtain guide data for all the non-
  master backends.



        [1mNOTE[22m: Do not run mythfilldatabase on a non-master backend.

  [1m9.5.  Grabbing channel icons for DataDirect users[0m

  While the DataDirect TV listings service has several advantages, it
  does not support grabbing logo icons for the stations you receive.
  However, there are utilities provided with MythTV which you may use to
  grab your initial set of icons and to keep them updated if your
  lineups change.

  First, you need to generate or obtain an XML file with the information
  for your stations.

  If you have XMLTV software installed, there is a perl script in
  MythTV's contrib/ directory which will generate this file for you. Run
  the command:


       $ perl mkiconmap.pl



  You will be asked for your zip code and the service that you use. If
  there are no errors, the iconmap.xml file that you need for the next
  step will be created.

  If you do not have XMLTV software installed and do not want to install
  it for the sake of this minor task, there is a generic
  contrib/master_iconmap.xml which you can copy and use but this may not
  be as complete as using the specific information for your service.

  Once you have an iconmap.xml file, add the icon information to your
  database and grab any new icons with the command:



  $ mythfilldatabase --import-icon-map iconmap.xml --update-icon-map



  [1m10.  Configuring mythfrontend.[0m

  Once you have completed configuration of your backend systems, the
  next step is to configure the frontend client.

  When you start mythfrontend for the first time, it will attempt to
  connect to a configuration database on the local machine.  If there is
  none, a "Database Configuration" screen will appear, and you will need
  to fill in some details.  The "Host name" field needs the backend or
  database server's IP address or DNS name, and the User or password
  fields may need to be set to match your database user accounts.  After
  editing those fields, press Enter twice to write these configurations
  on your local machine, and attempt to connect to the database.  If you
  make any mistakes, the screens will pop up again.

  Now that mythfrontend has started up, you should have a number of
  buttons/choices.  Before doing anything, go to TV, then to Setup and
  configure the frontend client.



        [1mNOTE[22m:  You should go through the various setup screens in
  mythfrontend before using any other modules such as MythMusic, etc. to
  correctly initialize the database.

  [1m10.1.  General[0m

  The General screen has configuration items that don't really fit
  anywhere else.  The first few configuration items asks you to indicate
  the number of seconds to record before or after a program, which is
  useful if the broadcast network or your system clock are out of sync
  and will help prevent you missing the beginning or end of a program.

  To change the value, use the left and right arrow keys to increment
  and decrement the number of seconds.  When you're satisfied with the
  result, use the down arrow to put the input focus on the Next button
  or press RETURN to continue to the next page.

  The next page has a number of options to do with how channels are
  displayed on your system.  The help text will give you more
  information.  Move the focus to Next and press the space bar to
  continue.

  The final General page sets up some final configuration items.  See
  the help text for more information.


  [1m10.2.  Appearance[0m

  This set of screens is mostly concerned with how MythTV will look on
  your system.  From here, you can choose different themes and set the
  resolution of your system.



  [1m10.3.  Program Guide[0m

  Fairly self explanatory.  Note that the alternate program guide does
  not use the same font settings as defined in Appearance, so if the EPG
  is unreadable this is where you make the adjustments to fonts, number
  of elements displayed, etc.


  [1m10.4.  Playback[0m

  The one configuration item which may cause problems on your system is
  the "Deinterlace playback" setting.  MythTV uses a linear blend
  algorithm for deinterlacing, which will improve how the image looks on
  your screen.  Deinterlacing requires that your processor support SSE.
  (Streaming SIMD Extensions, aka "MMX2").  Early Intel Celeron (those
  that don't use the Coppermine 0.18um core and are usually <600MHz),
  Pentium Pro and Pentium II CPUs do not have SSE, so make sure that you
  haven't enabled deinterlacing if your processor doesn't support it. If
  you enable it, and your processor doesn't support SSE, you will get
  "Illegal Instruction" errors.

  To determine if you've got SSE on an Intel processor, you can:


       $ cat /proc/cpuinfo
       [snip]
       flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca
       cmov pat pse36 mmx fxsr sse



  Notice the [1msse [22mat the end of the line - this tells you that this
  processor will be able to deinterlace correctly.

  On an AMD processor, look for "3dnow" in the cpuinfo line; "3dnow" is
  AMD's implementation of SSE instructions, so if your processor has
  3dnow you shouldn't have any issues with deinterlacing.

  [1m10.4.1.  Video Filters[0m

  MythTV provides a facility to include video filters while recording
  and during playback. These filters can be used to improve or modify
  the video image, including hiding the effects of an interlaced image
  or reducing the effects of noise in a poor video signal. The following
  is a brief introduction to introduce you to the filters that are
  available in MythTV version 0.18.1.

  [1m10.4.2.  Applying filters[0m

  One or more filters can be included in a "filter chain". The filters
  to be used are identified in a "filter string". A filter string is a
  group of filter names and parameters separated by commas.  To include
  parameters, the filter name is followed by "=" and the parameter
  information. There should be no spaces in the filter string. Here is
  an example filter string:

  With parameters: kerneldeint=10:1,denoise3d=12

  Without: kerneldeint,denoise3d

  Recording filters are set for each individual channel. These may be
  used when encoding in software (MPEG-4, RTjpeg) but do not apply when
  using a capture card with hardware encoding such as those supported by
  the ivtv driver, DVB, HDTV or MJPEG cards. You can run MythTV's
  "setup" program and select the "Channel Editor". On the first page for
  each channel, you can enter a filter string in the box titled "Video
  filters". If you are running "mythweb" on your web server, you can
  click on "Settings" then "Channels" and enter filter strings in the
  "videofilters" column.

  Playback filters are per-host and apply to any recording you watch
  from the frontend where filters have been applied. Playback filtering
  can only work with software decoding so the viaslice, xvmc, and ivtv
  outputs ignore filters entirely. From "mythfrontend" go to Setup->TV
  Settings->Playback.  Enter your filter string in the box titled
  "Custom Filters".


  [1m10.4.3.  Currently Available Filters[0m

  "Deinterlace Playback" checkbox.

  This implements special behavior needed for the "bobdeint" filter but
  can also be used to choose any of the deinterlace filters. If you
  prefer, you may leave this unchecked and include any of the
  deinterlace filters, other than "bobdeint", in your custom filter
  chain.


  o  The "invert" filter

  Invert ignores any parameters and inverts the pixel values of the
  video frames.  In other words, a negative image. This would rarely be
  useful but may be a good example to verify that your filter strings
  take effect.

  o  The "linearblend" filter

  It is a simple deinterlacing filter that ignores parameters and works
  by blending adjacent lines.  It replaces combing in interlaced video
  with a less distracting "ghost" image.

  o The "bobdeint" filter

  This filter splits the interlaced image into two separate fields that
  can be line doubled then displayed at twice the frame rate. If the
  display is at the same refresh rate as the recording (59.92Hz NTSC or
  50Hz PAL) this will cause each refresh to show objects in motion in a
  new position with no jagged edges. However, if the display is not
  synchronous, it will cause flickering or the appearance of the picture
  moving up and down by one line.



         [1mNOTE[22m: This filter requires the frame rate to be doubled
  and therefore can only be used with the "Deinterlace Playback"
  checkbox.  Do not include this in your filter chain.

  o  The "kerneldeint" filter

  Kerneldeint is a more complex deinterlacing filter which applies a
  filter kernel using input from several lines.  It generally removes
  combing without a "ghost" image, sometimes leaving a faint outline of
  the image from the other field. It is considered to be less
  distracting to watch than linearblend or no filter at all. It accepts
  one or two integer parameters separated by a colon.


  The first parameter is the filter threshold and defaults to 12.
  Adjacent lines differing by more than the threshold value are
  filtered. The second option defaults to 0.  If set to a non-zero
  value, it will cause the filter to skip chroma, and filter only the
  luminance.  It may be useful on some capture cards which do not
  capture the chroma fields of interlaced video correctly.

  o The "onefield" filter

  This is a simple one-field deinterlacing filter that uses only one
  field of the interlaced video.  By default it keeps the top field,
  though passing the parameter "bottom" will cause it to keep the bottom
  field instead.

  This filter is primarily useful for those who display 1080i HDTV
  signals with a video mode that has 540 pixels vertically.  The
  advantage over other deinterlacing filters is that scenes with motion
  never show combing or ghosting.

  o The "adjust" filter

  This filter adjusts the digital values for luma and chroma to ensure
  that they will fall within the ranges specified in the ITU-R601
  standard. By default, this corrects a known problem for the luma range
  used by bt8x8 chips which causes video to look washed out. If
  parameters are passed, there need to be exactly six. However, passing
  a single parameter of "-1" will disable the filter.

  1: luma minimum input value (int) 2: luma maximum input value (int) 3:
  luma gamma correction (float) 4: chroma minimum input value (int) 5:
  chroma maximum input value (int) 6: chroma gamma correction (float)

  The default bt8x8 correction values are equivalent to
  "16:253:1.0:2:253:1.0".  Output ranges are fixed at ITU-R601 values
  (16-235 luma, 16-240 chroma).

  [1mNOTE[22m: If it is not already specified in the filter chain, this filter
  will be automatically applied when recording with the "bttv" driver.

  o  The "quickdnr" filter

  A fast temporal denoiser. This can take 1, 2 or 4 parameters, each
  being a value from "0" for the least filtering to "255" for the
  greatest filtering.  With one parameter, the filter will compute the
  values it should use for all of its variables. Two parameters will set
  the filter strength for luma and chroma independently. If you are
  interested in how the algorithm works, you may examine the source code
  to see how four parameter are used.

  o  The "denoise3d" filter

  A slower denoiser that applies a spatial and temporal low-pass filter.
  The spatial filter can remove some noise that quickdnr can't, but a
  more powerful CPU is needed.  This filter accepts 3 float parameters:


  +o  luma spatial filter strength

  +o  chroma spatial filter strength

  +o  luma temporal filter strength

  Reasonable defaults will be selected for omitted parameters.  The
  chroma temporal filter strength is calculated from the other filter
  strengths.

  o  The "crop" filter

  Covers edges of video with black bars.  This helps improve video
  quality when the edges of the frame are distorted. By default, this
  removes 16 pixels from each edge. This can optionally take four
  parameters representing top:left:bottom:right. The number times 16 is
  the number of pixels to remove so, for example, the default is
  "=1:1:1:1".

  o  The "forceyv12" and "forceyuv422p" filters

  These force the filter manager to use the given format.  You can use
  one of these at the head of a filter chain to change the capture
  format. The most likely use would be forceyuv422p to use YUV422P
  capture on cards with known chroma interlacing problems with YV12.

  There are some filters included in the MythTV source code that should
  not be used:

  o  The "forcergb24" and "forceargb32" filters

  The two RGB formats should not be used because there is no conversion
  filter for them yet.

  o  The "convert" filter

  It exists but don't use it.  The filter manager uses this filter
  automatically when it is unable to match the input/output formats of
  two adjacent filters.

  o  The "postprocess" filter

  While this exists in MythTV source code, it is currently not
  recommended for use.


  [1m10.4.4.  Usage Considerations[0m

  There are trade-offs to consider when deciding if it would be wise to
  use a filter. Any processing will modify the original image so you
  should assess if the filter has made a noticeable improvement to the
  picture in order to justify the impact of the processing.  Adding any
  filter will inherently increase CPU usage. The impact can vary
  dramatically depending on your CPU type and speed, the resolution of
  the recording, which filters you are using and other factors. You can
  only determine what is right for you through experimentation. However,
  as a starting point, here are some filter strings that you may find
  useful:

  For typical broadcast stations: "kerneldeint,quickdnr"

  For stations with poor signal quality: "linearblend,denoise3d=12"

  For synchronous TV-out: check Deinterlace with "Bob (2x framerate)"


  [1m10.5.  Recording[0m

  Depending on your capture card, MythTV offers different video
  encoders.  The following types of hardware encoding cards are
  supported:

  +o  MJPEG - Zoran-based cards; see http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net
     <http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net>


  +o  MPEG-2 - iTVC15/16 based cards (Hauppauge PVR-250/PVR-350); see
     http://ivtv.sourceforge.net <http://ivtv.sourceforge.net>

  +o  HDTV - pcHDTV cards; see http://pchdtv.com <http://pchdtv.com> and
     the Air2PC-ATSC-PCI see
     http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&products_id=103
     <http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&products_id=103>

  +o  DVB - cards supporting DVB; see http://linuxtv.org
     <http://linuxtv.org>

     For cards without hardware encoding capabilities (all cards
     supported by V4L not listed above), Myth includes two methods for
     software encoding: RTjpeg and MPEG-4.  RTjpeg has significantly
     fewer CPU demands than MPEG-4, but it generates larger files than
     MPEG-4 for a given recording.

  For DVB and HDTV cards, no further configuration is required after
  setting up the card using the 'setup' program.  For all other cards,
  configuration is done through MythFrontend.  Selecting 'Recording
  Profiles' from the 'TV Settings' screen will list the profiles
  currently available for the cards in your system.  Depending on what
  types of cards you have installed you may see:


       (Create new profile group)
       Software Encoders
       Hardware MPEG Encoders
       Hardware MJPEG Encoders
       Transcoders



  The '(Create new profile group)' option will allow you to create cus-
  tom profiles in case you have multiple backends.  Note that custom
  profiles are per backend and card type.  If you have 2 MPEG-2 encoders
  in a given backend system, creating a custom profile will affect both
  of them.  This option should not be needed otherwise.

  The 'Transcoders' group is a little different from the others.
  Selecting this group will result in a menu with the following options:
  'RTjpeg/MPEG-4' and 'MPEG-2'.  These types indicate what transcoder
  options will be used for a given input type (i.e. the 'MPEG-2'
  settings would be used to transcode MPEG-2 files into MPEG-4.  The
  source of the MPEG-2 stream (DVB, HDTV, or PVR-x50) does not matter.
  Configuration of the options is the same as below (although any
  resolution settings will be ignored).

  Selecting any of the other options will show a new screen with a list
  of four profiles:

  +o  Default

  +o  Live TV

  +o  Low Quality

  +o  High Quality

  The Default profile will be used for any recording which does not
  otherwise have a specific profile assigned. The 'Live TV' profile will
  be used when watching TV.  The remaining two profiles are available
  for customizing to allow for more precise control over what quality is
  used for a given program.

  Selecting a profile will allow you to adjust the relevant options for
  that card.  The most significant setting is the recording resolution,
  but you can also choose encoding format, audio format, and tweak other
  encoder specific properties.



       [1mNOTE[22m: although the width and height can be changed to almost
  anything, if you start MythTV and don't see video or you get
  "segmentation fault" errors, it is likely that the video4linux (v4l)
  subsystem did not like the height and width parameters specified.
  It's best to leave the default as-is until you're sure that MythTV is
  operational.

  See the ``What capture resolution should I use? How does video work?''
  section for more information.


  [1m10.6.  Xbox Frontends[0m

  MythTV is able to control the LED on the Xbox to indicate backend
  recording status.

  To control the LED, you will need the [1mblink [22mprogram from the xbox-
  linux project, which is installed as /bin/led on GentooX.  On Xebian
  (the new Ed's Debian) you must install it yourself.  On other
  distributions it may or may not be installed as a program called [1mblink[0m
  and should be located in your path.  (Type which blink to see if the
  program is available.) If you do not have [1mblink[22m, you may obtain it
  from the Xbox-Linux project site at http://xbox-linux.sf.net/
  <http://xbox-linux.sf.net/>. The program you need is part of the
  eds_i2c_staff module in CVS.  Note the spelling.

  Once you have installed [1mblink [22myou will need to set permissions.  [1mblink[0m
  needs write permission to the i2c device to function properly.  There
  are three methods to accomplish this.  First, you could run
  mythfrontend as root, which is the simplest method, but could
  potentially be a security risk.  Next, you may make the [1mblink [22mbinary
  setuid root, which allows non-privileged users to run a program with
  root capability.  This is done by typing the command:


       $ su
       # chmod u+s /path/to/blink



  The final technique would be to set the /dev/i2c/0 device read/write
  for all users, but this is the least preferred method.

  Now it's time to setup MythTV for Xbox hardware.  Enter Setup ->
  General.  On the second page check the 'Enable Xbox Hardware' option.
  Upon reentering the settings, you should have a new option named
  'Xbox'.  Within this option you may select the distribution, LED
  colors for recording and the update interval.  If you select GentooX
  as the distribution [1mled [22mwill be used as the [1mblink [22mbinary name,
  otherwise, [1mblink [22mis used.  Colors should be self explanatory.  The
  update interval determines how often the frontend should poll the
  backend to determine if the status has changed.



  [1m11.  Using MythTV.[0m



       [1mNOTE to Red Hat/Fedora users[22m: Red Hat Linux and Fedora Core
  ship with Gnome as the default desktop environment.  However, Gnome
  seems to have issues with window focus and window switching which
  sometimes cause mythfrontend to obscure the video. KDE does not seem
  to have any such issues. Therefore you will need to switch to KDE by
  selecting RedHatMenu>Extras>System Settings>Desktop Switching Tool and
  choose "KDE".

  [1m11.6.  Using Shutdown/Wakeup[0m

  What does the MythTV Shutdown/Wakeup function do? The scheduler on the
  Master backend (MBE) keeps track of the idle status of the entire
  MythTV system, including the Slave backends (SBE). If it considers the
  system to be idle, and thus ready to shutdown, it sets the wakeuptime
  to the time of the next recording and then proceeds to shut down all
  Slave backends and then itself. Once it is time to begin recording,
  the Master backend and the Slave Backends are automatically woken up.
  This system allows MythTV to record like a normal VCR, thereby
  conserving power when not in active use.

  In order to use the Shutdown/Wakeup function there must be some method
  of waking up the Master backend.  There are any number of solutions,
  but we will discuss in detail two possibilities:


  +o  Use another server that runs 24/7 and have it send a WakeOnLAN
     (WOL) packet to wake the Master backend.  This assumes that you
     have the WOL tools installed, and that your Master backend
     motherboard supports WOL.

  +o  Use your motherboard's BIOS wakeup capability.  You'll need a
     motherboard that supports BIOS wakeup, and some tools.  Two that
     work are: http://sourceforge.net/projects/nvram-wakeup
     <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nvram-wakeup> and
     http://www.malloc.de/tools/wakeup_clock.html
     <http://www.malloc.de/tools/wakeup_clock.html>


  [1m11.6.1.  A deeper look into the operation[0m

  The scheduler keeps track of the idle status of the MythTV system. To
  determine whether or not the MythTV system is idle, the following
  conditions must be met for a period of time defined in the "Idle
  timeout (secs)" parameter.

  +o  no client is connected to the server

  +o  no recording (neither LiveTV nor a regular recording) is currently
     taking place

  +o  no recording starts within a definable amount of time ("Max. wait
     for recording (min)")

  +o  the "pre Shutdown check-command" returns 0

  If we get to this idle state the Master backend will set the
  wakeuptime using the "Set wakeuptime command", which is the same for
  WOL and BIOS wakeup. The Master backend will then shut down the Slave
  backends and itself using the "Server halt command".

  One caveat is that the scheduler tries to guess if the Master backend
  was started by a wakeup call or by the user. If it thinks it was woken
  up by a user, it blocks shutdown until a client connects to the Master
  backend, after which it will behave as described above. To disable
  this feature, unset "Block shutdown before client connected" in the
  mythfrontend Setup->Setup->General screen.

  Once it is time to startup the system, the Master backend is woken up
  first and will wakeup the Slave backends using the "Wake command for
  slaves". At this time, there is no support for starting only the
  required Slave backend, so all Slave backends will startup.


  [1m11.6.2.  Setting up the MythTV side of this extension.[0m

  There are a number of options that are used to control the Shutdown /
  Wakeup feature.

  Shutdown/Wakeup Options:

  +o  "Idle timeout (secs)" is the time the server waits while idle until
     a shutdown occurs.

  +o  "Max. wait for recording (min)" is the time the Master backend
     waits for a recording without shutting down. For example, this
     would be used to prevent a 10 minute system shutdown if a recording
     is set to start 15 minutes from now.

  +o  "Startup before rec. (secs)" Sets how long before a programmed
     recording the MythTV system will be woken up.  This should be
     roughly be the time your systems need to bootup, and if you have
     Slave backends, you'll need to ensure this value is long enough for
     all your machines to perform their bootup cycle.

  +o  "Wakeup time format" is the format of the wakeup time that is given
     in the "Set wakeuptime command" as a parameter "$time". You need to
     set this according to your wakeup mechanism. If you need seconds
     since the epoch (1970-01-01) set the "Wakeup time format" to
     "time_t".

  +o  "Set wakeuptime command" is the command executed to set the new
     wakeuptime.

  +o  "Server Halt Command" is the command executed to shutdown the
     Master backend and the Slave backends.

  +o  "pre Shutdown check-command" is an optional command used to give a
     "Go/NO-GO" decision from a non-MythTV source.  This command is
     executed immediately before the shutdown would occur. The return
     value is use to make the following choices:

     +o  If it returns a "0" the shutdown will occur as scheduled.

     +o  If it returns a "1" the "idle timeout" will be reset and the
        system waits again for the timeout.

     +o  If it returns a "2" the entire shutdown sequence is reset.  This
        means that a new client connect is needed before a shutdown
        occurs, unless you have the "Wait for client connect" setting
        disabled, in which case this is the same as returning "1".  An
        example of a use for this return value is to prevent the
        shutdown if a user is currently logged in, or if a specific
        program (i.e. transcode, automatic updates, etc.) is currently
        running. If you don't need it, leave the field blank.

  The "WakeOnLan settings": These settings have nothing to do with using
  BIOS or WOL wakeup, they are the same for both.

  +o  "Master backend" This setting defines timings for the frontends to
     wakeup the Master backend using WOL. Useful if your frontend can
     emit a WOL packet so you don't need to physically go to the Master
     backend if you're trying to watch TV.

  +o  "Reconnect wait time (secs)" is the time the frontend waits after
     executing the "Wake command" before attempting to retry the
     connection. This should be roughly the amount of time your Master
     backend needs for bootup.  Set to "0" to disable. The frontends
     will retry to connect for "Count of reconnect tries" times before
     giving up.

  +o  "Wake command for slaves" is the [4mone[24m command executed to wake your
     Slave backends. This should be a script that contains the calls to
     wakeup all Slave backend systems.


  [1m11.6.2.1.  Using WOL to wake your Master backend.[0m

  To use WOL to wake your Master backend you will need a WOL capable
  Master backend, a machine that runs 24/7 which can execute an at-job
  and nc (netcat) on the Master backend. I use some little bash scripts
  to make my DSL router wakeup my mythbox if required.

  Replace $SERVER and $PORT with your own settings!  On my Master
  backend I have a script that gets called as 'setwakeuptime command'
  which looks like the following:


       #! /bin/sh
       echo $@ | nc $SERVER $PORT



  This simply cats the parameters (that is $time) to my 24/7 server. On
  my $SERVER I have (x)inetd listening on $PORT starting a little script
  which cares about setting the at-job. The following additions are nec-
  essary on the $SERVER:

       mythwake stream tcp nowait mythtv /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/bin/mythwake



  If you use [1mxinetd[22m, save the following as [1mmythwake [22min your
  /etc/xinet.d/ directory:


       service mythwake

  If, for example, one of the Slave backends is also your desktop

  a value sufficient for you to react.  You could then popup a window
  using *dialog, asking for permission to shutdown. If you cancel the
  shutdown, simply call /sbin/shutdown -c.

  If you get "nvram-wakeup: /dev/rtc: Device or resource busy" your set-
  wakeuptime-script should stop the program that uses /dev/rtc before
  setting the wakeuptime.


  [1m11.7.  Scheduling Recordings[0m

  The MythTV master backend is responsible for managing the schedule for
  all TV tuner cards on the master and any slave. It's job is to search
  the TV listing for the shows you have requested and assign recordings
  to the TV tuner cards. If none of the shows that you've chosen
  overlap, it simply records all of the shows. However, if there are
  shows where the beginning and end times overlap, the scheduler follows
  rules that you've specified or makes logical decisions about what
  would be best if you haven't express your preference. Further, the
  "Upcoming Recordings" page allows you make specific decisions about
  what you really do and don't want to record.


  [1m11.7.1.  Record Types[0m

  When you choose a show that you would like to record from the Options
  Page, there are eight different types of rules to help the scheduler
  find which showings you would like to record.


  +o  Single Record -- record only this title at this specific time. This
     is the best way to be sure that a certain showing is recorded.
     However, if the TV listings change and the show is not broadcast at
     that time, the show will not be recorded.

  +o  Find One -- this will record a title once from any of the times
     that appear in the TV listings. This is useful for recording a
     movie or special that has multiple showings because it allows the
     scheduler to choose one that doesn't conflict. It is not a good
     choice for recording a single episode of a series because it
     records the first available showing of the title without regard to
     the episode information.

  +o  Record Weekly -- this records a show whenever the title is listed
     on the same channel, weekday and time. Note that if the TV station
     changes the schedule for a special episode, it would not be
     recorded. However, you can add a Single record for the special
     episode.

  +o  Find Weekly -- this will record a title once per week from any of
     the times that appear in the TV listings beginning from the time of
     the showing that was selected when the rule was set. This is useful
     for news, current events or other programs where the same episode
     is shown several times each week but the listings may not include
     descriptive information. This is not a good choice if there are
     different episodes shown during the week.

  +o  Record Daily -- this records a show whenever the title is listed
     for the time and channel on any day of the week. Here again, a show
     will not be recorded if the time was altered by the station.

  +o  Find Daily -- this will record a title once per day from any of the
     times that appear in the TV listings beginning from the time of the
     showing that was selected when the rule was set. This is useful for
     news, current events or other programs where the same episode is
     shown several times each day but the listings may not include
     descriptive information. This is not a good choice if there are
     different episodes shown during the day.

  +o  Channel Record -- records a show anytime the title is listed on
     this channel.  This is perhaps the most common rule to use for most
     shows.

  +o  Record All -- record this title on any channel at any time. This
     can be useful if a station has sister stations where shows are
     rebroadcast allowing the scheduler to record rebroadcasts on the
     other station when the original airing cannot be recorded.


  [1m11.7.2.  Duplicates[0m

  Singles will record without regard to duplicate matching.

  The standard recurring methods of All, Channel, Weekly and Daily use
  the descriptive information in the TV listings to try to record only
  one showing of each unique episode. However, This goal is sometimes
  complicated by the fact that the stations may not include a
  description for a specific episode but use a generic description for
  the series instead. When there is a generic description, the default
  behavior is to assume that it may be an episode that you have not seen
  and to record it for you.  One of the duplicate matching options is
  "Record new episodes only".  If this is selected, listing that have an
  original air date of more than 14 days earlier are considered repeats
  and are not eligible to record. Generally, generic episodes will be
  marked as repeats also.


  Because of generic episodes and other situations, MythTV offers an
  alternative approach where shows may be recorded by choosing from
  multiple showings even when the descriptive information is not
  reliable.  All of the "Find" record types look for matching titles in
  the listings. If there is a showing with specific episode information
  and that episode has recorded before, that showing is marked as
  previously or currently recorded. The scheduler will then choose to
  record the earliest non-conflicting showing from any of other
  remaining showings regardless of the descriptive information.
  Generally, Find One is most useful for movies or specials and the Find
  Daily and Find Weekly rules are best for news or current events shows
  that are repeated. However, these may be useful in other situations
  where the standard recording rules may not work correctly.


  [1m11.7.3.  Conflicts[0m

  As you add more shows that you would like to record, the scheduler
  will eventually encounter conflicts. If there are two shows at the
  same time and you have two or more TV tuner cards, both shows will
  record. However, if there are more shows than cards, the scheduler
  will have to decide what it thinks it should not record based on the
  information you have given. If you see an unexpected situation you are
  not "stuck" with the scheduler's choice. You can still tell the
  scheduler exactly which shows you do want to record and/or don't want
  to record in any situation.


  [1m11.7.4.  Priority[0m

  By default, all shows you select are have equal value to the
  scheduler.  There are a set of rules to make good choices when two or
  more shows are in conflict. However, priority values let the scheduler
  know what you want so that it can set the schedule based on your
  preferences.

  Initially all priority values are set to zero. You may choose to leave
  everything at "0" and let the scheduler follow rules to guess what you
  might prefer when there are conflicts. However, if you have one or two
  favorite shows, you may want to increase the priority value so the
  scheduler will know that you would prefer recording these over other
  shows. You might use certain values to rate shows so that all
  favorites are 2. good shows are 1 and extra 'filler' shows are all -1
  for example. You could sort each title on the "Set Priorities" to have
  a unique value so the scheduler can always know which show you'd
  prefer verses any other show. The choice and style are entirely up to
  you. However, the more information you give to the scheduler, the more
  likely it will make the choices you would like in the first place.

  The scheduler choices are based on the total priority for a showing by
  adding up four different priority factors. By default, all of these
  factors are "0" but you may use any combination to express your likes
  and needs.

  Per record rule -- this is the "priority" field in the "Scheduling
  Options" section of the options page and this values is included for
  any showings that match the recording rule.  You may choose to only
  use these values and not use the other factors for the sake of
  simplicity and clarity.

  Per record type -- Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->General
  allows you to add to the priority based on the type. It may make sense
  to increase the value for "Single" so that by default they have an
  extra advantage over other shows. You may want to decrease the value
  for Find rules so that they will be less likely to interfere with
  regular shows and will be more likely to record in a non-conflicting
  time instead.

  Per channel -- Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->Channel
  Priorities can be useful if you believe that you prefer any of the
  shows on certain channels. This would give all shows on a channel an
  advantage by default.

  Input preference -- in the MythTV "setup" program, the "Input
  Connections" section allows you to add additional priority in the
  "Input preference". This is simply another priority factor but has an
  interesting effect. If a card input has a higher value than the other
  cards, the scheduler will see that you would rather record showings of
  episodes on this card rather than a showing on another card. If you
  have multiple cards of different quality, you may want to set input
  preference to encourage the scheduler to record shows on your best
  card(s) whenever possible. This can also be useful if you have
  multiple video sources which include the same stations. For example,
  with digital and analog cable you could increase the digital cable
  input preference by 1 to tell the scheduler that you want to record
  from the digital station whenever possible but the station on the
  analog input could still be used when the digital input is busy.

  For any single showing of any show you've chosen to record, these
  factors are added together to find the "total priority". This is the
  priority that the scheduler uses to decide which shows are given the
  first choice when filling in the schedule.


  [1m11.7.5.  Scheduling decisions[0m

  Here are the actual decisions made by the scheduler as it fills in the
  schedule.


  +o  Currently recording beats not currently recording -- A recording in
     progress can not be moved so it "wins" it's current timeslot.

  +o  Higher total priority beats lower total priority -- This is the
     core of the scheduling process. Episodes of the highest priority
     show are placed on the first available card then the next highest
     priority and so on.

  +o  Future start time beats passed start time -- If there is an episode
     in progress and also a later showing of the same episode, it is
     better to record the complete episode. If there isn't another
     showing, start recording now to record the remaining portion.  This
     should only happen if you add a new rule while the show is in
     progress or if the master backend is started after the start time
     of a scheduled show.

  +o  More specific record type beats less specific record type -- If two
     shows are on at the same time and have the same total priority but
     different types they will be sorted by Single then Find One, Record
     Weekly, Find Weekly, Record Daily, Find Daily, Channel and finally
     All. This only applies if the priorities are the same.

  +o  If both start times have passed, later start time beats earlier
     start time -- This attempts to miss the least amount of time.

  +o  If neither start time has passed, earlier start time beats later
     start time -- This rule help assure that the earliest showing of an
     episode has the advantage.

  +o  Lower input id beats higher input id -- The scheduler fills in open
     time slots on the first available card. The next cards is used when
     there is another show already placed for the first card.

  +o  Older record rule beats newer record rule -- If two shows are still
     equal after all of these other checks, the show whose record rule
     was added first is preferred over a more recent addition.


  [1m11.7.6.  Reschedule Higher Priorities[0m

  Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->General has a checkbox for
  "Reschedule Higher Priorities" which tells the scheduler to try to be
  a little smarter in certain situations. If this is checked, the
  scheduler will look for situations where a show cannot record because
  all inputs for the channel are used for higher priority shows. It will
  check to see if any of the other shows could be recorded at another
  time so that the conflicting show can be recorded in it's place.

  Generally, this is a good strategy but there are tradeoffs. If a
  higher priority show is postponed, you will not get to watch it until
  it is recorded in the later timeslot. There is also a risk that the TV
  listings may change and the later showing may go away. In this rare
  case the higher priority show may never record. On the other hand, if
  you do not use this option you will miss recording some lower priority
  shows unnecessarily unless you make similar these changes manually.

  By using Reschedule Higher Priorities, the scheduler will do a better
  job of recording as many of your shows as possible when left
  unattended. It will also be easy to see that shows have been marked to
  record at a later time.  You can then decide for yourself when you
  would prefer to record the first showing.


  [1m11.7.7.  Controlling Your Schedule[0m

  The Manage Recordings->Upcoming Recordings page is your control center
  for the MythTV scheduler. Unlike other DVR systems, this one page
  gives you all of the information and tools you need to see all of your
  alternatives and make whatever adjustments you desire.

  The upper half of the screen has a scrollable box listing items that
  match your record rules sorted by time. The lower half shows the
  details for the highlighted item. There are two 'views' available.
  Press "1" to include all of the items that match record rules even if
  they do not need to be recorded. Press "2" to focus on just the things
  that will record and items that may need your attention. The message
  in the upper right-hand corner will remind you when there are
  conflicts that would prevent one or more shows from being recorded.

  The items in the list are colored white for things that will record,
  gray for those that do not need to record and yellow when there is a
  time conflict. Items at the top of the list may also be highlighted
  indicating that the recording is in progress.

  Along with the channels, start times and titles, the right-hand column
  has a status code. Numbers indicate which card number has been
  assigned to record the show. Letters are used to indicate the reason
  that something will not be recorded. Just below the box is a short
  status message for the highlighted item that indicates the type of
  record rule that was matched and a one or two word explanation of the
  status code. If you press SELECT, you will see more information about
  the status.

  There are a few status codes that may require your attention. "C"
  indicates that there are more overlapping shows to record than there
  are TV tuners to record them. "L" indicates that the scheduler found
  that it may be better to record a later showing of this episode. These
  states happen as a result of your choices and should normally reflect
  your preferences. However, you may notice situations where you would
  like to modify the scheduler's initial choices.

  The first thing you can do is to highlight an item and press INFO once
  or twice to see the Recording Options page. From this page you can
  change the record rule type, the duplicate matching rules, or raise or
  lower the priority to resolve whatever problem you noticed.

  Additionally, you can treat any individual showing as an exception
  that you do want to record or don't want to record. To use these
  "override" features, highlight the item and press SELECT. You will see
  a message explaining the current status and at least an "OK" button to
  exit without making changes.

  For items scheduled to record, there will be a button for "Don't
  record" which will prevent recording this showing but will still allow
  the same episode to record in the future. If there is episode
  description information, you may also see a button for "Never record".
  This prevents recording this showing and tells MythTV to remember that
  this is an episode that you've seen or don't need to see if it is ever
  in the TV listings again.

  For items that are not scheduled to record, the message will describe
  the reason and in the case of "C" or "L" it will include a list of the
  shows that are scheduled to record instead. For any item that could
  potentially be recorded there will be buttons for "Edit Options" and
  "Add Override". "Edit Options" will allow you to change the options
  for the existing record rule such as raising the priority so that the
  show will record. These changes would apply to this and all future
  showings that match this record rule.  "Add Override" will allow you
  to set options that apply to the specific showing without affecting
  the existing record rule.

  If you return to an override page after an override has already been
  set, you will also see a "Clear override" to undo your changes. This
  option makes it very easy to try out some "what if" attempts when
  deciding on your best strategy in a difficult situation.


  [1m11.8.  Advanced Recording Options[0m

  Creating Power Search rules with Custom Record

  MythTV's "Custom Record" feature gives you unlimited control for
  creating specialized search recording rules to meet your needs. It
  allows you to choose your criteria to search for matching shows based
  on any of the information in the program listings, channel
  information, time functions and more. This goes beyond the
  capabilities of any other DVR system and it is unlikely that this
  level of scheduling customization will ever be available in any
  commercial DVR system.

  [1m11.8.1.  Getting Started[0m

  Go to Schedule Recordings->Custom Record. This page, titled "Power
  Search Recording Rule Editor", helps you build a database search one
  clause at a time. Each added clause further limits which showings will
  be matched in the TV listings data. You can test the search at any
  time and when you are done, you can save your search as a recording
  rule.

  To familiarize yourself with how you can create custom rules, create a
  simple rule to record "Nova" only in primetime.

  The first item at the top of the page allows you to edit an existing
  rule or create a new rule. Leave it on "<New rule>". Arrow down to the
  third item which says "Match an exact title". Right and left arrows
  would allow you to select any of several prefabricated pieces or full
  examples but leave it on the default for now. Arrow down to "Add this
  example clause" and press SELECT (Enter or Space on a keyboard). The
  large text box should now show:


            program.title = "Nova"



  As you have probably guessed, this says that we want to search for all
  programs with the title "Nova" regardless of the time, day, channel,
  etc.

  If you do not receive a PBS station that carries "Nova" or would like
  to use another title, edit the title by pressing the down arrow to
  highlight the text box and right arrow over the the word "Nova". If
  you are using a keyboard you can simply delete the four letters and
  type a different title between the quotes. With a remote control, you
  can do 'cell phone' style text entry with the number pad. The delete
  key is the "X" in the grouping for "1", zero is grouped with "9" and
  "0" acts as the "Caps Lock" key.

  Note: the text box honors many familiar Emacs control keys. It is also
  possible to cut and paste text into the text box so you can edit with
  a favorite editor or insert a rule sent in email or from other
  sources.

  In any case, choose a title that is shown both in primetime and late
  night or daytime. Next, click the "Test" button. You should see a list
  of the upcoming episodes for "Nova" just as if you had clicked the
  Upcoming button for "Nova" elsewhere in MythTV.

  Press ESC to go back to the Custom Record page. Move to the example
  selector then press the right or left arrows until you find "Only in
  primetime". Click "Add this example clause". You should now see:


                   program.title = "Nova"
                   AND HOUR(program.starttime) >= 19
                   AND HOUR(program.starttime) < 23



  Click "Test". You should now see a shorter list with only the showings
  that begin between 7PM and 11PM. To create a rule for this, press ESC
  to go back to the custom page and move to "Rule Name:" then type
  "Nova" or anything else you would like. This is only a label and will
  not affect the search results. Once a name has been entered, the
  "Record" button will light up.  Click this to enter the recording
  options page. If you named it "Nova" the title will say "Nova (Power
  Search)". Set whatever options you would like then click "Save these
  settings". You now have a special rule to record "Nova" but only when
  it is shown in primetime.

  To remove this, or any other rule, you can go to the "Recording
  Priorities" page, arrow down to the title, press Enter and change the
  the recording type to "Do not record this program" then "Save these
  settings".


  [1m11.8.2.  How it Works[0m

  MythTV stores TV program information in a database and uses the
  Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the data. Information about
  each TV program is stored in the 'program' table and information about
  each TV station you receive is stored in 'channel'. These two tables
  are used in the scheduler queries and their fields are available to be
  used in your rules. The rules you create are stored in 'record'.
  Normal rules in MythTV simply match the title in the rule with the
  titles in the 'program' table.

  MythTV also has search rules for "Titles", "Keywords" and "People".
  These store the key phrase in the description field of the rule and
  includes them in specialized SQL replacements for the normal title
  check. There is also a type called "Power Search" which takes the raw
  SQL in the description as the replacement for title matching.

  Custom Record is a tool to help you build valid SQL for Power Search
  rules.  You do not need to be a SQL expert to use Custom Record
  because the examples are known to work correctly and are usually self-
  explanatory so you can choose the pieces you need then modify them.
  Many powerful solutions to unique problems are possible by combining
  the examples. With some creativity and some knowledge of SQL, the
  possibilities are limitless.


  [1m11.8.3.  Common Tricks and Tips[0m

  The example clauses marked "complete example" are actual rules that
  have been used to address specific problems. You may find that some of
  these are useful for you as-is or with slight modifications. These
  show off how powerful custom rules can be but there are also several
  simple idioms that you may find useful for many of the shows you would
  like to record.

  Wait for a known title -- If there is a movie that you anticipate will
  be televised in the coming months but is not yet in the listings, you
  can select "Match an exact title", edit the movie title, click
  "Record" then choose "Record one showing of this title". The rule will
  wait weeks, months or years until this title shows up in your listings
  then it will record one showing. These rules have no impact on the
  scheduler throughout the day and only take a tiny fraction of a second
  when the master backend starts or when the listings are updated.

  Silence series out of season -- "Celebrity Poker Showdown", for
  example, will have new episodes for a while then long periods where
  reruns are shown dozens of times per week. By checking the previously
  shown flag you can create a rule that will only match new episodes.
  Therefore, your schedule won't be polluted with dozens of entries
  marked as "Repeat" or "Previously Recorded".



         program.title = "Celebrity Poker Showdown"
         AND program.previouslyshown = 0



  This allows you to keep rules for your favorite shows that are dormant
  while out of season but will spring back to life when new episodes
  appear.

  Choose showings on certain days -- Several cable stations will show
  their highest rated shows a dozen on more times per week. However, the
  scheduler only needs two or three choices to do a good job of making a
  flexible choice.


              program.title LIKE "Celebrity Fit Club%"
              AND DAYNAME(program.starttime) = "Sunday"



  This says to choose any showing of an episode that hasn't been
  recorded when it appears on Sunday. This prevents all the other show-
  ings during the week from being listed in the schedule.

  Notice the word "LIKE" and the "%" at the end. This does wildcard
  matching so that this would match even if the title ended with "2".
  "III" or ":Revenge of the Snapple Lady". This can be useful where the
  title may change from one season to the next like "Survivor%", "Big
  Brother%" or "The Amazing Race%".


  [1m11.8.4.  Working with SQL[0m

  As you experiment, it is possible that you may misplace a quote or
  mistype a word. If there is a mistake when you press "Test" or
  "Record" you will see an error message returned from the database.
  This will usually give you a good idea about what needs to be fixed.
  However, for more subtle MySQL syntax errors, you can find more
  information in the documentation at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/
  <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/>. This contains a lot of
  information that can be useful for Power Search rules such as the
  "Date and Time Functions". There are many other good resources for SQL
  on the Web.

  While the example clauses demonstrate how many of the data fields may
  be used, you can get a more complete list of all the fields that are
  available by using a MySQL client program:


       $ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg
       mysql> describe program;
       mysql> describe channel;



  This will show the names of all of the fields along with their type
  and default value. Most are easy to understand but a few need some
  explanation in order to use them effectively with Power Search.

  +o  "program.category_type" holds one of these exact four strings:
     "movie", "series", "sports" or "tvshow".


  +o  "program.airdate" is a string representing the year of release for
     movies and may have no meaning for other types of shows.

  +o  "program.stars" is a floating point number from 0.0 to 1.0. On a
     four star scale, 1.0 would be four stars, 0.75 would be three stars
     and so on.

  +o  "program.originalairdate" if provided is the date when a show was,
     or will be, first televised. This may be useful for finding
     episodes before or after a certain date such as finding just the
     original series of "Battlestar Galactica".

  +o  "program.previouslyshown" is a field created by MythTV to try to
     determine if a showing is more than 14 days after its original air
     date or if the show was marked as a repeat and did not have a date
     for the first airing. If this is "0" it usually means that this is
     a brand new show or a rebroadcast within the first two weeks.

  +o  "program.programid" is the Tribune Media Service database record
     identifier for each program description. In general, these start
     with a two letter prefix, MV, EP, SP or SH that correspond to the
     "program.category_type".  For most, the last four digits are "0000"
     except EP where the last four digits are the episode number in the
     series. Note that these are generated by TMS and not the show's
     producers but they are usually in the same order as the original
     air dates for the episodes. Detailed information can be found in
     the Data Direct documentation at http://labs.zap2it.com/

     Finally, if you are doing something very experimental and a field
     is not giving you the results you had anticipated, you can always
     check the MythTV source code to see exactly how a field is used.

  The sections detailing configuration of the plugins assume that you
  are already in the ~/mythplugins-0.18.1/ directory.

  Note that a single [1mconfigure [22mscript now does configuration for all
  modules.  By default, it will compile all modules.  If you do not wish
  to compile a module, either because it is of no use to you, or you do
  not have the prerequisites, the simplest course of action is to go
  through the various sections below, satisfying the prerequisites, and
  then compile all modules at once.

  For example, you would only like to compile and install MythGallery
  and MythMusic.  For MythGallery, you would like to use the EXIF data
  in the .JPG file to present additional information onscreen.  For
  MythMusic, you would like to enable support for the opengl and FFT
  visualizations.  The command line would look like:

       $ cd ~/mythplugins-0.18.1
       $ ./configure --disable-all --enable-opengl --enable-mythgallery --enable-exif --enable-mythmusic --enable-fft
       $ qmake mythplugins.pro
       $ make
       $ su -
       # make install
       # exit
       $



  For simplicity, the examples below will disable compilation of all
  other modules other than the one being discussed.


  [1m13.  MythWeb.[0m

  MythWeb allows you to use a web page to control various aspects of
  your MythTV system.  MythWeb is a separate application, but it's
  dependent on MythTV being installed and operational.


  [1m13.1.  Installation and prerequisites[0m

  Mythweb is a part of the [1mmythplugins [22mpackage.  See ``MythPlugins'' for
  instructions on downloading the tarball. The next step depends on
  whether your distribution has a web server and if you have PHP
  support.


  [1m13.1.1.  Mandrake[0m

  Mandrake has [1mapache [22mand [1mPHP [22mpre-packaged, so installation is quite
  simple.  Once you have installed the two programs, either with the
  graphical installer (see instructions in ``Graphic Install Tools'') or
  through the command line (section ``Command Line''), and you've
  ensured that the [1mapache [22mserver will start at boot using the Mandrake
  Control Center.



             [1mNOTE[22m: Mandrake 9.1 users, perform the following:


       # urpmi apache2 apache2-mod_php php-mysql
       # chkconfig --level 345 httpd on
       # /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart



  [1m13.2.  Completing the installation[0m



  $ cd ~/mythplugins-0.18.1/mythweb
  $ su
  # mkdir /var/www/html/mythweb
  # cp -r . /var/www/html/mythweb
  # exit
  $



  Edit the /var/www/html/mythweb/config/conf.php file if required.

  By default, MythWeb uses an Apache .htaccess file to restrict access
  to the website and to configure some variables.

  To create the password file for Apache (if your system doesn't already
  have one), you could do something like this:


       # cd /var/www
       # htpasswd -c htpasswd mythtv
       New password:
       Re-type new password:
       Adding password for user mythtv



  See the man page for [1mhtpasswd [22mfor more examples.

  To access the web page, open a web browser and use [1mhttp://[name or ip[0m
  [1maddress]/mythweb/[0m



        [1mNOTE[22m: Make sure that you have a trailing slash on the URL,
  otherwise you will get a 404 Page not Found error.

  [1m13.3.  Resetting the key binding table[0m

  MythWeb allows you to configure which keys are bound to which actions
  within MythTV.  If you'd like to reset this back to the default,
  execute the following command:


       $ echo "delete from keybindings ;" | mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg



  [1m13.4.  Resetting the theme.[0m

  If you find yourself wedged into a theme that isn't working, open your
  web browser and go to site:
  http://mythweb_name_or_ip_address/mythweb/settings.php?RESET_THEME=yes

  [1m14.  MythGallery.[0m

  MythGallery is a photo and slideshow application.  MythGallery is a
  separate application, but it's dependent on MythTV being installed and
  operational.


  [1m14.1.  Installation and prerequisites[0m

  MythGallery is a part of the [1mmythplugins [22mpackage.  See ``MythPlugins''
  for instructions on downloading the tarball.

  There are a number of transitions available, some requiring OpenGL
  support.  You will also need to install a TIFF library.  Under
  Mandrake, you would perform the following command:


       # urpmi libtiff3-devel



  Once you have satisfied the prerequisites for your distribution,
  install the application:


       $ cd ~/mythplugins-0.18.1
       $ ./configure --disable-all --enable-opengl --enable-mythgallery
       $ qmake mythplugins.pro
       $ make
       # su
       # make install
       # exit
       $



  The configuration for MythGallery is accessed through the main Setup
  option in mythfrontend.  Make sure you set your pictures directory to
  wherever you're storing your photos.

  The controls for MythGallery can be found in the README that comes
  with the application.

  [1m14.2.  Using MythGallery[0m

  When you first start MythGallery, you will see a thumbnail view of any
  folders and pictures in the Gallery Directory you specified in setup.
  If this is the first time you have accessed this directory, the
  thumbnails will be generated on the fly.  If the Gallery Dir is
  writable, these thumbnails will be cached thus speeding up future
  access.  On the left is a greyed-out menu of options.

  Use the arrow keys to select a folder or picture to open/view with the
  Select key, or use the Menu key to toggle access the menu on the left.
  The menu options are as follows:

  +o  Slideshow - Will cycle through all the pictures in the current
     folder.  The currently selected item must be a picture (not a
     folder) for this to work.  It does not currently traverse
     subfolders.

  +o  Rotate CW - Rotate the current image 90 degrees in the clockwise
     direction.  This change persists if the current directory is
     writable.

  +o  Rotate CCW - As above except the direction of rotation is
     counter(anti) clockwise.

  +o  Import - Import pictures into your Gallery Dir.  This option is
     described in the next section.

  +o  Settings - Access the MythGallery settings screen.

  [1m14.3.  Importing Pictures[0m

  The import path in the setup dialog is a colon separated list of
  directories and/or executable files.  When the import key is pressed,
  a new directory (the destination directory) under the current
  directory will be created and the import path will be searched.  If
  the item in the import path is a directory (the source directory), the
  contents of that directory will be copied to the destination
  directory. If you would like the source directory to be that of a
  removable device, it might be a good idea to use autofs.  See the
  automount howto at www.linuxdoc.org <www.linuxdoc.org> for info on how
  to get it working.

  If the item in the import path is an executable file, MythGallery will
  attempt to execute it with the destination directory as its sole
  argument.  Be careful when using executable scripts that the script
  runs unattended (doesn't need user intervention) and returns properly,
  otherwise it could create the appearance of MythGallery hanging (e.g.
  running [1msmbclient [22mand prompting for password).  Also be sure that
  scripts have executable permissions set.

  Here is an example script that a user may want to run on import:


       #!/bin/csh

       if ($#argv == 0) then
               echo "Usage: $0 dest_dir"
               exit
       endif

       cd $argv[1]

       # get stuff over the network
       wget http://www.somesite.dom/dir/file1.jpg
       wget http://www.somesite.dom/dir/file2.jpg
       wget http://www.somesite.dom/dir/file3.jpg

       # stuff that requires manual module loading and/or fs mounting
       modprobe camera_module
       mount /dev/camera /mnt/camera
       cp /mnt/camera/* $argv[1]
       umount /mnt/camera
       rmmod camera_module

       # perform some processing
       foreach pname (`ls *.jpg`)
               jpegtran -flip vertical $pname > $pname.new
               mv $pname.new $pname
       end



  [1m15.  MythGame.[0m

  http://www.mameworld.net/ <http://www.mameworld.net/> is an excellent
  resource for all things mame.

  Installation overview:

  1. Setup directory structure

  2. Download and install xmame

  3. Download and place files (artwork/catver.ini/etc..)

  4. Download and install mythgame plugin

  5. Setup mythgame from inside mythfrontend

  6. Hints: No joystick solution

  [1m15.1.  Setup Directory Structure[0m

  To keep things organized, create the following directories for [1mxmame[0m
  to use in /usr/local/share/xmame: hiscore, roms, and snaps.



       $ mkdir -p /usr/local/share/xmame/{highscore,roms,snaps}



  [1m15.2.  Download and Install xmame[0m

  Download the source to [1mxmame [22mfrom
  http://x.mame.net/download/xmame-0.97.tar.bz2
  <http://x.mame.net/download/xmame-0.97.tar.bz2>



       $ wget http://x.mame.net/download/xmame-0.97.tar.bz2
       $ tar -xjf xmame-0.97.tar.bz2
       $ cd xmame-0.97



  Edit the Makefile with your favorite editor.  Adjust the options as
  required for your system.


       $ joe Makefile



  Then make and install xmame


       $ make
       $ su
       (enter password)
       # make install
       # exit



  After [1mmame [22mhas been installed, we need to create some defaults.


       $ mkdir ~/.xmame
       $ cp docs/xmamerc.dist ~/.xmame/xmamerc


  Because some ROMS work better with different display toolkits, or
  possibly even older versions of xmame, it's convenient to keep all of
  your [1mxmame [22mbinaries and to rename them to include the version number,
  then make a symbolic link to "xmame". If you want to test a different
  version of [1mxmame [22mat some point you only need to switch this link.



       $ su
       (enter password)
       # mv /usr/local/bin/xmame.x11 /usr/local/bin/xmame-0.97.x11
       # ln -s /usr/local/bin/xmame-0.97.x11 /usr/local/bin/xmame
       # exit



  [1mNOTE[22m: Depending on how you compiled [1mxmame[22m, you may have [1mxmame.X11[22m,
  [1mxmame.SDL [22mor [1mxmame.xgl [22mbased on what display toolkit you used. Also,
  you may need to remove and recreate xmamerc after upgrading since some
  of the default options may have changed.

  Confirm that [1mxmame [22mworks before running it inside MythTV. Place your
  ROM in the /usr/local/share/xmame/roms directory you created earlier.

  [1mNOTE[22m: There are three public domain ROM sets available at
  http://www.mame.net/downmisc.html <http://www.mame.net/downmisc.html>

  Launch [1mxmame [22mwith your game of choice.  In this example, we are using
  Gauntlet.


       $ xmame gauntlet



  Some basic [1mmame [22mkeyboard commands:


       5 = Insert coin
       1 = Player 1 start
       arrow keys = movement
       left control = button 1
       left alt = button 2
       SPACE = button 3
       ESC = exit
       TAB - menu
       ~ to adjust Volume
            < and >



  [1m15.3.  Download extra files[0m

  The following files allow you to add extra functionality.  Place them
  into /usr/local/share/xmame

  - catver.ini is a catalog of categories and versions of popular mame

  Mandrake has a number of the prerequisites available on the
  installation CD.  Some of the software you're going to need will have
  to be obtained from the "contrib" or "cooker" development
  repositories.  Applications downloaded from "cooker" come from the
  development branch, so there may be issues with some software.  It
  isn't recommended that you mix cooker and release-level software.

  [1m16.3.  Red Hat Linux 9[0m

  Red Hat provides packages for several of the prerequisites, making
  installation very simple. Of the prerequisites, Red Hat provides
  packages for Vorbis, cdparanoia, SDL, and OpenGL (which you probably
  already have installed). To install these all at once, simply type
  (all on the same line):


       $ up2date --solvedeps libvorbis libvorbis-devel vorbis-tools cdparanoia-devel cdparanoia-libs cdparanoia SDL-devel SDL



  If you get the following message: "None of the packages you requested
  were found, or they are already updated" it probably means you already
  have all of those packages installed.

  You must install the remaining packages, (MAD, FLAC, libcdaudio and
  optionally fftw) manually following the installation directions above.
  When installing fftw do not use the rpm package offered on the website
  because it will cause an error, so use the source package instead.


  [1mNOTE[22m: you can use the instructions given at the ``automated
        installation section'' to install all of MythMusic in one
  step.

  [1m16.4.  Compiling MythMusic[0m

  Once all the prerequisites have been installed, you can proceed with
  compiling MythMusic.



       $ cd ~/mythplugins-0.18.1
       $ ./configure --disable-all --enable-mythmusic --enable-fftw --enable-sdl --enable-aac
       $ qmake mythplugins.pro
       $ make
       $ su
       # make install
       # exit



  [1m16.5.  Configuring MythMusic[0m

  Configuration of MythMusic occurs in two places.  The main
  mythfrontend Setup is for global MythMusic configuration.  Go to the
  Setup/MythMusic/General Setup screen and adjust it for your particular
  configuration.

  The second configuration screen is within the MythMusic program and
  will allow you rescan your music library, etc.

  Here's some explanation about the Ignore_ID3 and The
  NonID3FileNameFormat:

  If Ignore_ID3 is set to TRUE, MythMusic will try to determine the
  Genre, Artist, Album, Track Number, and Title from the filename of the
  mp3 file.  The NonID3FileNameFormat variable should be set to the
  directory/file format where the mp3 files are stored.  For instance, I
  store mine in the above shown Genre/Artist/Album/Track format.
  MythMusic will then use this information to fill in the proper fields
  when it populates the musicmetadata table rather than searching for an
  ID3 tag in the mp3 file.

  The files can be laid out in any format, such as:

  Genre/Artist/Album/Title Artist/Genre/Album/Title Artist/Album/Title
  (with Genre left as Unknown)

  The track number is optional but can be specified with the title by
  using the TRACK_TITLE keyword instead of TITLE.  If TRACK_TITLE is
  used, then the filename can have a space, hyphen, or underscore
  separating the track number from the track title.  Keywords are case
  insensitive, so if you specify GENRE it's the same as Genre in the
  format field.

  The Ignore_ID3 option does not disable the code that determines the
  track length, just the portion that tries to read ID3 info.


  [1m16.6.  Using MythMusic[0m

  MythMusic is fairly simple to use.  It is recommended that you insert
  the CD before selecting "Import CD".  You should also ensure that your
  system doesn't try to automount the CD and begin playing it
  automatically.

  Here's some information on playlist management:

  Q: How do I create a new playlist?  A: Using the MythMusic "Select
  Music" menu option, setup the playlist as you normally would by adding
  songs or other playlists as needed.  When you are ready to save the
  new playlist, highlight "Active Play Queue" at the bottom of the
  selection tree and hit the "i" key. This will pop up a menu allowing
  you to name and save the new playlist.  You can also hit Enter to
  bring up the popup on the Active Play Queue. This does not work on the
  playlists above, as Enter is obviously bound to checking/unchecking
  the boxes. Any number (i.e. keypad on remote) will also bring up the
  menu in both cases.

  Q: How do I enter the playlist name in the text field without a
  keyboard?  A: Use the keypad number keys (bound to your remote) to
  select letters quasi-cell phone style. Keys 2-9 work pretty much like
  any cell phone text entry. 1 cycles through a few special characters,
  delete, and space. 0 is like a CAPS LOCK. Hard to describe, fairly
  easy to use. You will soon be able to specify the cycle timing in a
  Setup screen. You can type fairly quickly through a combination of
  jumping around the number keys AND hitting a non-number key (right
  arrow is particularly good for this) to force the current character.

  Q: How do I edit a playlist?  A: Highlight the playlist in the
  selection tree and hit the "i" key then select "Move to Active Play
  Queue" in the popup.  You can now modify the "Active Play Queue" like
  normal, adding songs and playlists by selecting them from the song
  tree.  When you are done, highlight the "Active Play Queue" in the
  selection tree and hit the "i" key then select "Save Back to Playlist
  Tree".  And whatever you were editing as your Active Queue before you
  moved an existing playlist "on top" of Active reappears. Think of
  Active has having a push on, pop off capability, but with a depth of
  only 1.

  Q: How do I delete an item from a playlist?  A: Highlight the item in
  the selection tree and hit the "d" key.

  Q: How do I rearrange the songs in my playlist?  A: Highlight a song
  and hit the "space" bar, the song will now have pair of red arrows in
  front of it.  Use the up and down arrow keys to move it around in the
  playlist.  When you have it where you want it, hit the "space" bar
  again.

  Q: How do I delete a playlist?  A: Highlight the playlist in the
  selection tree and hit the "i" key then select "Delete this Playlist"
  from the popup.


  [1m16.7.  Troubleshooting MythMusic[0m

  You may run into errors when running MythMusic.

  [1m16.7.1.  When I run MythMusic and try and look up a CD, I get an error[0m
  [1mmessage[0m

  The full text of the message will say:

  databasebox.o: Couldn't find your CD. It may not be in the freedb
  database.  More likely, however, is that you need to delete  /.cddb
  and  /.cdserverrc and restart mythmusic. Have a nice day.

  If you get this message, you should go to the home directory of
  whatever user MythMusic is running as and type:

  rm .cdserverrc
  rm -rf .cddb/



  These files aren't automatically deleted because of a conscious design
  decision by the author that programs that automatically delete things
  are bad.

  The files are used to locally cache CD lookups. If you are re-
  inserting CDs, your machine will not actually have to go out to the
  Internet to determine what is on them.  However, the URL used to
  access the freedb database has recently changed, so the stale
  information in the files from previous runs of MythMusic would cause
  the error above.  Once the files have been deleted the stale
  information will be gone and your local database will be rebuilt as
  you use CDs.

       $ su
       # make install
       # exit



  MythWeather uses MSNBC.com as its source for weather data and
  weather.com for its radar image.

  These are the keyboard commands for MythWeather:


       Left Key             Goes back one page, and extends the time spent
                            on the page you are on.
       Right Key            Goes forward one page, see above.
       Space                Pause, wait on the current page until space is hit
                            again.
       Numeric Keys         You can check other weather by keying in other ZIP codes.
       Enter Key            Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Can also
                            be used a way to force a data update.
       "m" Key              Resets the location to the database default, then updates the data.
       "i"                  Enter / Save settings
       ESC                  Exit the settings screen without saving / Exit the program



  MythWeather also has an "Aggressiveness" setting.  This affects how
  long MythWeather waits for data from the msnbc.com website before
  timing out.  If you are on a slow connection, or have a slow DNS, or
  MythWeather just doesn't seem to be working and you've already tried
  everything else, then try increasing the aggressiveness level
  parameter.  This parameter is inverse; a higher number actually means
  that MythWeather will be less aggressive, and will therefore wait
  longer before timing out.

  MythWeather will print debugging information on the terminal.  If you
  wish to see additional debugging information while MythWeather is
  running, run mythweather from the command line with as mythweather
  --debug

  You may also force mythweather to re-run the configuration by starting
  it on the command line as mythweather --configure.  These two options
  are mutually exclusive.


  [1m18.  MythVideo.[0m

  MythVideo will allow you to use an external program to watch media
  files that are not directly supported by MythTV.

       $ qmake mythplugins.pro

  See MythVideo's README file for additional information.


  [1m19.  MythDVD.[0m

  MythDVD is a part of the [1mmythplugins [22mpackage.  See ``MythPlugins'' for
  instructions on downloading the tarball.  MythDVD is an application
  which rips DVDs and makes them available for use with MythVideo.  You
  may also transcode the DVD content from MPEG-2 to other formats which
  should greatly reduce the amount of space the DVD material takes up on
  your hard drive.

  MythDVD has a number of prerequisites to enable transcoding
  functionality.  If you only wish to play DVDs rather than convert them
  to something like MPEG-4 or xvid you may skip the prerequisite
  installation step.


  [1m19.1.  Manual Compilation of Prerequisites[0m


  [1m19.2.  Pre-compiled binaries[0m

  Mandrake users may install the prerequisites this way:


       # urpmi libdvdread3 libdvdread3-devel a52dec liba52dec-devel
       # urpmi mplayer ogle xine



  Assuming that you've added a PLF mirror, you may also load the rest of
  the prerequisites using the following command:


       # urpmi xvid xvid-devel fame libfame0.9-devel transcode libdvdcss



  In the example below, we have enabled support for transcoding and for
  VCD playing.  You may remove these options if you don't need them.


       $ cd ~/mythplugins-0.18.1
       $ ./configure --disable-all --enable-mythdvd --enable-transcode --enable-vcd
       $ qmake mythplugins.pro
       $ make
       $ su
       # make install



  [1m19.3.  Running the Myth Transcoding Daemon[0m

  Transcoding ("ripping") a DVD requires you to run the Myth Transcoding
  Daemon (mtd).  To ensure that mtd is configured correctly, you should
  first test it at the command line.


       $ mtd -n



  The last line of text should show something like:


       mtd is listening on port 2342



  This indicates that mtd is ready for use.  Once you've successfully
  tested mtd in the foreground, type [1mCTRL-C [22mto stop mtd.  You may then
  start it as a background (daemon) process.


       $ mtd -d



  Running mtd as a daemon will allow you to automatically start it
  during the boot process.  For example, you may add mtd -d to your
  rc.local file, or you can adjust the script/steps outlined in the
  section called ``Automatically starting mythbackend at system boot
  time'' to start mtd instead of mythbackend.

  [1m21.  Troubleshooting.[0m

  [1m21.1.  Compiling[0m

  [1m21.1.1.  Compile errors[0m

  Some compile errors are worse than others.  If you get an error that
  doesn't abort the compilation, and says something like:


       cc1plus: warning: changing search order for system directory
       "/usr/local/include"
       cc1plus: warning:   as it has already been specified as a non-system
       directory



  then it shouldn't be a problem.

  If you get an error like /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXext, the compiler
  is telling you that you don't have XFree86-devel installed, or that
  your distribution hasn't set it up correctly.  This needs to be fixed
  before MythTV will compile.


  [1m21.1.2.  error: can't find a register in class 'BREG' while reloading[0m
  [1m'asm'[0m

  This is due to the broken Qt that is being distributed by Suse.  To
  work around this, edit libs/libavcodec/Makefile and remove any "-fPIC"
  you find there and then recompile.


  [1m21.1.3.  make: *** No rule to make target[0m
  [1m/usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs/default/qmake.conf', needed by Makefile'.  Stop.[0m

  This error happens when there's a missing link in the
  /usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs directory.  There are two ways to fix this error:

  1.  Create the link manually:


       $ su
       # cd /usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs
       # ln -sf linux-g++ default



  and then restart the compile,

  or


  2.  Run [1mqmake mythtv.pro [22min the mythtv directory.  Rerunning [1mqmake[0m
  will create a new Makefile for you, however this still doesn't fix the
  root cause of the issue, which is that your distribution didn't create
  the symlink for you when the qt3 package was installed.  The first
  choice is the better solution.


  [1m21.1.4.  make: *** No rule to make target[0m
  [1m/mkspecs/default/qmake.conf', needed by Makefile'.  Stop.[0m

  You didn't set your QTDIR.  Re-read the section on ``Setting up

  than an actual programming fault within gcc.

  [1m21.2.2.  MythTV isn't doing anything[0m

  [1m21.2.3.  Debugging with GDB[0m

  Without details, the developers will not be able to determine if you
  have discovered a genuine code-bug,  or if the problem is with your
  system.  In order to determine what's going on, you must recompile
  MythTV with debugging support and run MythTV within [1mgdb[22m, the GNU
  debugger.

  Re-run the [1mconfigure [22mscript and add --compile-type=debug to any
  previous configuration options you may have used.  Check the
  config.log file if you have forgotten.

  Now, you need to clear out the old versions of the software to ensure
  that you're running with the debugging code, then compile and install.


       $ make distclean
       $ ./configure --compile-type=debug
       $ make
       $ su
       # make install
       # exit



  At this point, you now have debug-enabled software ready.  Let's
  assume that the problem you're having is in the setup program.



  $ cd setup

  [1m21.4.5.  Screen goes blank but returns when mouse is moved or keyboard[0m
  [1mis used[0m

  This is due to DPMS, the Display Power Management System, which is
  used to save power by turning off your monitor when the system decides
  that it's not being used or due to a screensaver that has defaulted to
  a blank screen.  MythTV now has DPMS support built-in, and should
  intelligently handle the screen.  Continue reading if you wish to
  override DPMS and force it off.

  Since it's likely that watching TV will not generate keyboard or mouse
  events for a time, you need to turn off DPMS and the screensaver.
  There are a few ways to do this.  You may also need to check your BIOS
  for power saving modes and disable screen blanking there as well.

  Edit your /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 or /etc/X11/xorg.conf file, and look
  for:


  Section "ServerFlags"
      #DontZap # disable <Ctrl><Alt><BS> (server abort)
      #DontZoom # disable <Ctrl><Alt><KP_+>/<KP_-> (resolution switching)
      AllowMouseOpenFail # allows the server to start up even if the mouse doesn't work

      Option "blank time" "0"
      Option "standby time" "0"
      Option "suspend time" "0"
      Option "off time" "0"
      Option "NoPM" "1"
  EndSection



  Also, look for:


       Section "Device"
           Identifier "device1"
           VendorName "nVidia Corporation"
           BoardName "NVIDIA GeForce 256 (generic)"
           Driver "nv"
           Option "DPMS"
       EndSection



  In this case, you would need to either delete the Option "DPMS" line,
  or change it to # Option "DPMS" to comment it out.  The next time you
  start XFree this change will take effect.

  Finally, check:


       Section "Monitor"
           Identifier "monitor1"
           VendorName "Plug'n Play"
           HorizSync 30-85
           VertRefresh 50-160

           # Sony Vaio C1(X,XS,VE,VN)?
           # 1024x480 @ 85.6 Hz, 48 kHz hsync
           ModeLine "1024x480"    65.00 1024 1032 1176 1344   480  488  494  563 -hsync -vsync

           # TV fullscreen mode or DVD fullscreen output.
           # 768x576 @ 79 Hz, 50 kHz hsync
           ModeLine "768x576"     50.00  768  832  846 1000   576  590  595  630

           # 768x576 @ 100 Hz, 61.6 kHz hsync
           ModeLine "768x576"     63.07  768  800  960 1024   576  578  590  616
       EndSection



  Ensure that there isn't an Option "DPMS" in the Monitor configuration.

  You can also turn off DPMS from the Command Line, but this will not
  survive a reboot.


       $ xset -dpms


  Using xset +dpms will turn it back on.

  Another technique to try, which will turn off the screensaver:


       $ xset s off



  You may also combine the command to turn off DPMS and the screensaver:


       $ xset -dpms s off



  Finally, depending on your distribution, you may be able to turn it
  off from within the control panel.

           ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd800-0xd807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
           ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd808-0xd80f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
       hda: 156301488 sectors (80026 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=9729/255/63, UDMA(33)
       hdb: 80043264 sectors (40982 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=4982/255/63, UDMA(33)



  From the listing above, you can see that hda, hdb and hdc are set for
  DMA, and hdd is set for pio.  If your kernel is not reporting DMA
  being enabled, you may need to recompile your kernel. Check your
  motherboard's chipset (look in the "ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support" section
  in "make menuconfig") for more information.

  Next, check that the hard drive has DMA enabled.  Use the [1mhdparm[0m
  program to check and enable DMA.


  # hdparm -d /dev/hd?



  will tell you the DMA status for your hard drives.  If you run [1mhdparm[0m
  with the -d1 parameter, it will turn DMA on.


  You may also setup your PC to do this at boot time, either by adding
  the command to your /etc/rc.local file, or by adding files to
  /etc/sysconfig.

  On Mandrake and other distributions, if you install [1mhdparm [22mfrom an RPM
  you will most likely get a /etc/sysconfig/harddisks file installed.
  This file will be parsed by the /etc/rc.sysinit script.  If you use
  the default harddisks file, your changes will affect all IDE devices
  (including CD ROMs).  If you wish to use different parameters for
  various devices, rename and/or copy the file to harddiskhda,
  harddiskhdb, etc.  Edit the file to your liking and on the next reboot
  your setting will be preserved.


  [1m21.5.3.  Frontend appears to be slow at jumping / seeking.[0m

  [1m21.5.4.  On-screen Display shows incorrect program length.[0m

  This may occur when MythTV doesn't have an accurate seek table.  Run
  [1mmythcommflag --rebuild[0m


  [1m21.5.5.  Troubleshooting audio[0m



      [1mNOTE[22m:  the following instructions do not apply to PVR-250/350
  encoders; the MPEG-2 file will have the audio embedded in the stream
  so it is not accessible using /dev/dsp.  See ``this'' in the PVR-250
  ``section'' for more information.

  Audio appears to be one of the bigger issues that users run into on
  the mailing list.  If the audio isn't configured correctly, then
  MythTV will often appear to hang, when in fact it is trying to
  manipulate the audio subsystem and failing.  You may or may not
  receive error messages indicating that the source of the error is the
  audio subsystem.

  You can not use [1mxawtv [22mto determine if your audio is working correctly,
  since [1mxawtv [22mis simply using the analog sound patched through line-in
  to line-out. It doesn't need to digitize the sound unless you are
  using the recording function.

  A better test to verify that sound will work for MythTV (and recording
  with [1mxawtv [22mfor that matter) is to startup [1mxawtv[22m, mute the line-in then
  run aplay /dev/dsp. You should hear the recorded audio slightly
  delayed behind the real-time video. You should see messages about
  "underrun". These can be ignored but they do confirm that the driver
  is loaded and there is an active device. Once this test succeeds,
  MythTV should work correctly because it writes to and read from
  /dev/dsp in the same way that [1maplay [22mdoes.

  To record audio along with video the audio signal must be digitized by
  a DSP so that the audio data can be stored in a file. On playback, the
  audio data is written to /dev/dsp and converted back to an analog
  signal. This analog signal should then be sent to your speakers. Here
  is what is needed in [1malsamixer[22m. If you are using an ALSA version after
  1.0.6, use [1malsamixer -V all[22m:

  CAPTUR source - the analog source to be sent to the DSP. This should
  be set to the input source from the tuner card to the sound card. In
  most cases this is Line but this could also be Aux, CD, Mic, etc.,
  depending on how you connect the input cable. This source should be
  muted to prevent patching through the analog sound. The volume of this
  source will not affect the record level.

  Capture mixer - this sets the level for the analog to digital
  recording.  While a volume of 100% is recommended for testing,
  distortion may occur.  Lowering this level to 75% to 85% may result in
  better audio quality.  "Capture" should be marked as the CAPTUR
  destination.

  PCM mixer - this sets the level for the digital to analog playback.
  While a volume of 100% is recommended for testing, distortion may
  occur. Lowering this level to 75% to 85% may result in better audio
  quality.

  Master mixer - sets the level for the analog signal sent to line-out
  or the speakers.

  You may also want to ensure that /dev/dsp , or whatever device file is
  being used, hasn't already been grabbed by another process, like [1mesd[0m
  or [1martsd[22m.  If the device file isn't available, then MythTV won't work.
  You may wish to run [1mconfigure [22mand enable support for these.

  If you wish to see what application is grabbing a resource, you can
  use the fuser command:


       # fuser -v /dev/dsp



  To disable aRts in KDE, go to KDE->Control Center->Sound->Sound System
  and uncheck the "Start aRts soundserver on KDE startup" box.  Run #
  killall artsd from the command line to stop the artsd program.

  If you're using multiple sound cards and multiple tuners, use
  alsamixer -c 1 to work with the second sound card.  The first card is
  #0, the second card is #1, etc.


  [1m21.5.6.  Mythbackend reports that your card is not reporting full[0m
  [1mduplex capabilities[0m

  [1m21.5.7.  The mythbackend program told me to look at this section[0m

  mythbackend does a check to see if your sound device is capable of
  full duplex operation.  If it's not, it's most likely that you're
  going to run into issues when you try to record and play sound at the
  same time.  If your backend is a separate machine than your frontend,
  then there's no problem, since you're only going to be doing one thing
  at a time with the card.  Likewise, if you're running the frontend and
  backend on the same machine, but you're using btaudio or a hardware
  encoder card such as the Hauppauge PVR-250, DVB cards or HDTV capture
  cards as your recording source and you're only using the playback
  function of your sound card, then you also shouldn't have an issue,
  since the sound card isn't being asked to perform two functions at
  once.

  If you can't get your sound card to go full-duplex and need it to,
  then check your distribution for updated sound drivers.  If your sound
  card is not capable of full-duplex operation, either because the
  drivers don't support it, or it has been designed that way, then
  you're pretty much out of luck and will either need to purchase a new
  sound card, or will need to get btaudio ``operational''.


  [1m21.5.8.  My remote doesn't work / works sometimes and not others /[0m
  [1m"ghost" keypresses[0m

  This can be due to a number of factors.  The simplest case is the
  "ghost" keypresses.  For me, it was due to compact fluorescent lights
  in the same room as the IR receiver, which the receiver was picking up
  as keypresses.  Once the lights were switched to incandescent bulbs,
  the ghost went away.

  You may have an issue with [1mlirc [22mmisinterpreting IR commands from a
  different remote.  I also have an issue where the TiVo "Peanut" remote
  will eventually cause [1mlircd [22mto stop responding; even though [1mlircd [22mis
  configured for the Pinnacle Systems remote, the TiVo remote IR
  patterns are being seen by the IR receiver.

  If your remote has been properly configured, and [1mirw [22mand [1mirxevent [22mare
  working correctly, then it's highly likely that your window manager is
  not giving focus correctly to the various Myth programs as they run.
  The following window managers are known to work correctly:


  +o  fvwm

  +o  blackbox  (using "Sloppy Focus" and "Focus New Windows")

  [1mNOTE[22m:  You do not need to use [1mirxevent [22mif you are using MythTV's
  native LIRC support, so the window manager focus issue does not apply
  in that case.

  [1m21.5.11.  Channels are off by one[0m

  There is no such thing as "Canada Cable"; Canada uses the same
  frequencies as the United States.  "Canada Cable" was a hack that some
  people used when they would discover that their channels were off-by-
  one, i.e. when tuning to channel 42, they might get channel 41 or 43.
  This is actually due to the tuner on the video capture device being
  mis-detected.  You must manually specify the tuner type in your
  /etc/modules.conf.  See the video4linux mailing list
  (https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list

  [1m21.5.15.  Can't change the channel when watching Live TV.[0m

  Something's wrong with your program database.  Did mythfilldatabase

  appropriate video4linux devices.  See the section titled ``Device
  Permissions'' for an example.


  [1m21.5.16.  Screen goes black when you try to play something[0m

  MythTV prints error and status messages to the shell that was used to

  XvMC is a NVidia driver feature which is supposed to help with

  [1m22.  Miscellaneous.[0m

  [1m22.1.  I'd like to watch the files without using MythTV / I'd like to[0m
  [1mconvert the files to some other format[0m

  MythTV comes with a utility called [1mmythtranscode [22mwhich can decode nuv
  files into raw format for use with other applications.  This command-
  line utility was not designed to be used by the end-user, but instead
  to be called by other applications or scripts.  Programs like [1mmkmovie[0m
  (http://www.icelus.org/ <http://www.icelus.org/>) and [1mnuvexport[0m
  (http://forevermore.net/myth/ <http://forevermore.net/myth/>) are
  better suited for the end user.  However, since [1mmythtranscode [22mcan be a
  useful tool, directions on using it follow.

  [1mmythtranscode [22mcreates raw streams, which means that they do not
  contain any container information such as resolution, frame-rate, or
  audio sampling rate.  In order to process the output, you must supply
  this information to the processing utility.  [1mmythtranscode [22mprovides
  the relevant information on STDOUT.

  There are two modes in which [1mmythtranscode [22mcan create raw streams.
  The first has no synchronization and assumes that the processing
  utility will read audio and video at a constant rate.  This method is
  useful when a single application will be processing the raw output,
  such as [1mmencoder [22mor [1mffmpeg[22m.  The second method assumes that two
  separate applications will be processing the audio and video streams
  independently, and there is no rate control between them which means
  that the two programs don't coordinate their efforts to maintain
  synchronization.


  [1m22.1.1.  mythtranscode example[0m

  First, start [1mmythtranscode[22m.  You will need to determine the channel
  and the start time manually.


       $ mythtranscode --chanid 1036 --starttime 2003-10-20T15:30:00 --profile \
       autodetect --fifodir . &



  When [1mmythtranscode [22mbegins executing, it will create two FIFOs
  ("audout" and "vidout") in the directory specified (in this case ".",
  meaning the current directory) and will print out information about
  the video stream.

  The next step is to start the processing application.  The following
  assumes that the stream is NTSC 640x480 with 32Kbps audio.

  To use [1mmencoder [22myou would enter a command like:


       mencoder -audiofile audout -audio-demuxer 20 -rawaudio rate=32000 \
       -rawvideo on:w=640:h=480:fps=29.97 -ovc lavc -oac mp3lame -o out.avi \
       vidout



          [1mNOTE[22m: You must use mencoder 1.0PRE1 or later. [1mmencoder[0m
  version 0.9x [4mWILL[24m [4mNOT[24m [4mWORK![24m  Using ffmepg:


       ffmpeg -f u16le -ar 32000 -ac 2 -i audout -f rawvideo -s 640x480 -r 29.97 \
       -i vidout -vcodec mpeg4 -b 2000 -acodec mp3 -ab 128 out.avi

  Or to play directly using mplayer (again 1.0PRE1 or later is needed):


       mplayer -audiofile audout -audio-demuxer 20 -rawaudio rate=32000 \
       -rawvideo on:w=640:h=480:fps=29.97 vidout



  If you wanted to write the raw data to separate audio and video files
  for later processing, the following would work (note the use of
  --fifosync for rate-control):


       $ mythtranscode --chanid 1036 --starttime 2003-10-20T15:30:00 \
       --profile autodetect --fifodir . --fifosync &
       $ cat audout > audio.raw &
       $ cat vidout > video.yuv



  [1m22.2.  Using a different window manager[0m

  MythTV is not dependent on any particular window manager.  If you wish
  to run a lightweight window manager, the configfiles/ directory has an
  example of a .twmrc and .fvwmrc file you may use.


  [1m22.3.  What capture resolution should I use?  How does video work?[0m

  While MythTV allows you to set various GUI and capture resolutions,
  not all combinations make sense.

  First, analog video signals have a defined vertical resolution.  In
  NTSC, the video standard specifies that there are 525 vertical scan
  lines.  Once the "extra" lines are removed (they're used to
  synchronize the video signal, and encode closed captioning data), you
  have 480 horizontal lines stacked vertically.

  In PAL, there are 625 "raw" lines of resolution, with a net of 576
  horizontal lines stacked vertically.

  Horizontally, the maximum value allowed for a Bt8X8 chip is 720.
  However, due to limitations in the chip and other limitations of
  broadcast television, there may not be a noticeable improvement in
  image quality beyond 400 or 500 pixels.

  With this in mind, there are certain commonly accepted values for
  resolution.  While other values may be accepted for the vertical
  resolution, they will cause scan lines to be repeated or dropped.

  From "best" to "worst", in NTSC:

  +o  720x480 ("DVD" resolution. Also commonly, 704x480)

  +o  640x480 4:3

  +o  544x480 (TiVo high resolution)

  +o  480x480 (Video CD resolution)

  +o  352x480 (ReplayTV "Standard" quality)


  +o  320x480

  +o  544x240

  +o  480x240

  +o  352x240

  +o  320x240

  As you can see, the lower quality values are half of the better ones.
  720x240 is possible, but isn't a good tradeoff relative to the number
  of vertical lines lost.  In a PAL country, the you would use values
  like 720x576 or x288.

  The higher resolutions will be more CPU intensive if you're using
  software encoding (PVR-250/350 will have minimal host CPU impact even
  if you're using 720x480). If the CPU is overtaxed, frames will be
  dropped causing uneven motion. You will likely see the best results at
  resolutions which average at least 10% CPU idle time.  You can use
  system tools such as top or sar to check the CPU % idle while
  recording.  If the CPU average usage is consistently exceeding 90%,
  frames will need to be dropped during peak times when more than 100%
  of the available CPU would be needed to process all of the frames.

  [1m22.4.  MythTV GUI and X Display Sizes[0m

  MythTV is designed to be run as dedicated full screen TV application
  but can also be run as a desktop application on a computer monitor.
  Here are a few consideration for configuring sizes to best suit you
  needs.


  [1m22.4.1.  X Dimensions[0m

  For output to a Television, common resolutions are 640x480, 800x600,
  and some rare devices support 1024x768. Generally, higher resolutions
  are better. However, you may find that you prefer the picture quality
  at one of the lower resolutions. Everything in MythTV is scalable and
  should 'fit' regardless of the resolution you choose.

  Edit your X configuration file, usually /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 for
  XFree, or /etc/X11/xorg.conf for Xorg, so that the resolution you want
  to use is listed first in the lists under "Screen". If this resolution
  is higher than the resolutions supported by your output device, you
  will see a 'panning' effect where moving the mouse to the edge will
  scroll around a desktop area which is larger than the display size. If
  this happens, edit your X configuration file to match the display size
  then restart X.


  [1m22.4.2.  MythTV Dimensions[0m

  In 0.10 and later, from "mythfrontend" go to Setup->Appearance.  The
  default for the height and width is "0" - this will cause MythTV to
  automatically size itself to full screen.

  If the MythTV GUI width and height are not 0, mythfrontend uses these
  GUI dimensions and is anchored to the upper left corner of the X
  Desktop. If the GUI X and/or Y are not 0, the upper left corner is
  positioned at the specified coordinates. If the "Run the frontend in a
  window" box is checked, the window will have a frame and can then be
  dragged to any position on the desktop.



      [1mNOTE[22m: When the GUI is full screen, you may see windows rapidly
  flipping on top of each other. If this happens you will need to set
  your window manager to 'Click to Focus' for windows to stack properly.
  The fonts for the GUI and OSD will scale to whatever sizes you use.
  Most font sizes can be changed in setup selections or in the .xml
  files under /usr/local/share/mythtv/ . Make sure to use fonts large
  enough to be read on a TV screen from a distance.

  The full screen TV size is based on the X display size. For Xinerama,
  you can specify a screen in Setup->General. The TV picture will be
  stretched to fit the entire GUI area regardless of the ``capture
  resolutions'' used. However, during playback, the "W" key can to used
  to correct differences between 16:9 and 4:3.


  [1m22.4.3.  Overscan Dimensions[0m

  Because picture edges can be ragged and screen edges aren't straight,
  Television is designed to project an image larger than the physical
  screen.  This is called "overscan". Underscan is fitting the entire
  image inside the screen. Underscan is useful for computer monitors so
  that toolbars and scrollbars at the edges can be seen.

  For best results, match the X display area as close as possible to the
  edges of the physical screen. This can only be adjusted by your tv-out
  device or by the settings for the television set. Many sets have these
  adjustments in a 'service mode'. If you cannot make these adjustments,
  there will be black borders around the edges of the X desktop, MythTV
  GUI and TV playback.

  MythTV has settings for "Overscan" in Setup->Playback. These can not,
  and do not, cause the image to display beyond the edge of the X
  display area. The purpose of these settings are to cut off rough edges
  and to expand the image so that objects will appear to be the same
  size as a normal overscanned TV picture.


  [1m22.5.  Saving or restoring the database[0m

  See the [1mmysqldump [22mmanpage for more information.


       $ mysqldump -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg -c > mythtv_backup.sql



  To restore: (assuming that you've dropped the database)


       $ mysql -u root
       mysql>create database mythconverg;
       mysql>exit
       $ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg < mythtv_backup.sql



  You may need to alter the MySQL permissions if this database is being
  shared with multiple systems.  See the ``Modifying access to the MySQL
  database for multiple systems'' section for more information.


  [1m22.6.  Deleting the MySQL database[0m



  [1mNOTE[22m:  Performing this step will remove the entire database. You will
   lose all of your settings and will need to re-run the mc.sql script
  to setup the database structure before running the setup program.


       $ mysql -u root
       mysql> drop database mythconverg;
       mysql> quit



  [1m22.7.  Moving your data to new hardware[0m

  This assumes that you will be moving your data to newer / bigger
  hardware and don't want to lose your programs.

  The first step is to create a database backup as demonstrated in an
  earlier section.

  Next, you will extract only the data that is relevant to the programs:


       $ grep "INSERT INTO record "         mythtv_backup.sql > restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO recorded "       mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO oldrecorded "    mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO recordedmarkup " mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql



  [1mNOTE[22m:  Newer versions of [1mmysqldump [22mplace backticks around the table
  names.  Backticks are not the same as apostrophes!  On a typical North
  American keyboard, backticks are located to the left of the "1" key,
  on the same key as the tilde.  Also, because the [1mbash [22mshell may try to
  interpret the backticks, make sure you use a \ before each one.

  If your restore.sql file is empty, you'll need to re-run the commands
  like this:


       $ grep "INSERT INTO \`record\` "         mythtv_backup.sql > restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO \`recorded\` "       mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO \`oldrecorded\` "    mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql
       $ grep "INSERT INTO \`recordedmarkup\` " mythtv_backup.sql >> restore.sql



  Note the space after the table name and the ">>" to append to the file
  for all but the first [1mgrep[22m. "recordedmarkup" is huge and may be
  hundreds of thousands of lines if you had lots of hours of recordings.

  After you have moved the data files to the new hardware, configure
  MythTV using the [1mmythtv-setup [22mprogram as you normally would with a
  standard MythTV installation.

  At this point we will restore the information about your programs back
  into the database:


       $ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg < restore.sql



  After successful insertion of the data you may delete the restore.sql
  file.


  [1m22.8.  btaudio[0m

  btaudio allows you to obtain the audio data from your tuner card
  directly over the PCI bus without using a sound card.  This is useful
  if you would like to use multiple tuner cards in a system without
  adding a sound card for each one, or if your existing sound card is
  not capable of full-duplex operation.

  In order to use btaudio, your tuner card will need certain hardware
  installed on it, and that hardware must be wired correctly.  The chip
  that will allow you to use the btaudio module is the MSP34xx.
  However, having a MSP34xx is no guarantee that you will be able to use
  the btaudio module.

  As of 2003-03-31, this is the current list of cards and their status:
  Works with btaudio:


  +o  Hauppauge WinTV-radio with dbx-TV stereo, model 401

  +o  Hauppauge WinTV-Theater, model 495, 498 (Europe)

  +o  ATI TV Wonder

  The following cards do not work:

  +o  Pinnacle Studio PCTV Pro - note: this has a MSP34xx, but it's not
     wired correctly to the BT878 chip.

  +o  ATI TV Wonder VE

  +o  Leadtek Winfast 2000 XP (PAL, UK and NTSC)

  +o  I/O Magic PC-PVR.  No MSP34xx chip.

  The following cards have been reported to work, but have issues:

  +o  Avermedia AVerTV Studio (no digital DSP output, "whiney noise" on
     analog)

  Once btaudio loads, it should register additional /dev/dsp and
  /dev/mixer devices.  Typing $ dmesg will let you know what's going on.


  [1m22.9.  Removing unwanted channels[0m

  If [1mmythfilldatabase [22mgrabbed a channel which you do not want to include
  in your TV listings, you can remove the entries from the grabber
  configuration and the MySQL database.  This often happens with premium
  channels; for example, HBO or Showtime may be available on your cable
  TV system, but is scrambled because you're not a subscriber to that
  channel.  Since you can never watch it, you want to get rid of it.

  If you are using the DataDirect service, login to your account at
  http://labs.zap2it.com/ <http://labs.zap2it.com/> to modify your
  lineup. Uncheck the boxes for any unwanted channels, and they will no
  longer be included in your download.

  If you are using a grabber from XMLTV, comment out the channel from
  the ~/.mythtv/<sourcename>.xmltv file by inserting the word "not "
  (including the space) in front of the unwanted entry. This will
  prevent [1mxmltv [22mfrom grabbing future listings.

  Next, delete the unwanted item from the channel table so that it will
  not appear in the EPG or when changing channels.  To delete the data
  from the database we need to perform some steps.  First, assuming that
  HBO is channel 15, we need to find out the internal chanid used by
  MySQL:


       $ mysql -u root mythconverg
       mysql> select chanid from channel where channum=15;
       +--------+
       | chanid |
       +--------+
       |   1015 |
       +--------+
       1 row in set (0.00 sec)
       mysql> delete from channel where chanid = 1015;



  Old program data will be removed over the course of a week. However,
  you may want to immediately delete any current program listings for
  the channel that has been removed:


       $ mysql -u root mythconverg
       mysql> delete from program where chanid = 1015;



  [1m22.10.  NFS[0m

  You may want to use a central server to store your files.

  On the host machine, (in this case, the hostname is "masterbackend")
  you'll want to edit your /etc/exports file and use something like:


       /var/video (rw)



  To export the /var/video directory with read / write privileges.

  On the "slave" machine, you'll want to edit the /etc/fstab file and
  add something like:



  masterbackend:/var/video /var/video nfs rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,nfsvers=3



  Then run # mount -a to re-read the file to mount the file system.

  In this case, the source is a machine called "masterbackend" which is
  exporting the directory "/var/video", which we're mounting locally at
  "/var/video".  The rsize and wsize options are used to increase the
  performance of NFS; "hard,intr" is there because that's the
  recommendation of the NFS-HOWTO, and the nfsvers is required for
  filesizes over 2GB.

  [1m22.12.  Automatically starting mythbackend at system boot time[0m

  [1m22.12.1.  Red Hat And Mandrake[0m

  Here's a method for automatically starting mythbackend submitted by
  Mike Thomson (mailto:linux@m-thomson.net <mailto:linux@m-thomson.net>)
  and Stu Tomlinson (mailto:stu@nosnilmot.com
  <mailto:stu@nosnilmot.com>).


  Copy the files from the MythTV contrib directory or from Mike's web
  site (http://m-thomson.net/mythtv/ <http://m-thomson.net/mythtv/>) as
  follows:

  etc.rc.d.init.mythbackend should be made executable and copied to
  /etc/rc.d/init.d/:


       $ cd contrib
       $ su
       # chmod a+x etc.rc.d.init.d.mythbackend
       # cp etc.rc.d.init.d.mythbackend /etc/rc.d/init.d/mythbackend



  etc.sysconfig.mythbackend should be copied to /etc/sysconfig/:


       $ cd contrib
       $ su
       # cp etc.sysconfig.mythbackend /etc/sysconfig/mythbackend



  Edit /etc/sysconfig/mythbackend if you want to change the defaults
  (the userid that should start mythbackend, location of the logfile and
  (if required) the name and location of the mythbackend binary).

  Use [1mchkconfig [22mto make sure the script is called when entering
  runlevels 3, 4 or 5:


       $ su
       # chkconfig --level 345 mythbackend on
       # exit
       $



  [1m22.12.1.1.  Log files[0m

  By default, the log file for mythbackend will be written to
  /var/tmp/mythbackend.log. This has been tested and is known to work on
  Mandrake and Red Hat, but many people prefer to place logs under
  /var/log/.

  To do this, create a group called mythtv (or anything you prefer) and
  add your usual MythTV users to that group. If you changed the user
  that starts mythbackend from the default of root you [4mmust[24m perform this
  step.

  Create the directory /var/log/mythtv and set its permissions as
  follows:



  $ su
  # mkdir /var/log/mythtv
  # chown root:mythtv /var/log/mythtv
  # chmod 0775 /var/log/mythtv
  # exit
  $ ls -ld /var/log/mythtv
  drwxrwxr-x    2 root     mythtv       4096 Apr 28 21:58 /var/log/mythtv/
  $



  [1m22.12.1.2.  Mandrake[0m

  Mandrake adds one more twist in the form of the msec utility, which
  runs regularly and (at the default or any higher security level) sets
  permissions on many files, including those under /var/log.

  To tell msec about the MythTV log files and their directory, you need
  to edit the /etc/security/msec/perm.local file to include the
  following:


       # /etc/security/msec/perm.local
       # Local overrides to the msec program
       #
       # Full file path                user.group              permissions
       /var/log/mythtv/                root.mythtv             775
       /var/log/mythtv/*               root.mythtv             664



  A copy of the above has been included in the contrib/ directory.  You
  may add it by typing:


       $ cd contrib
       $ su
       # cat etc.security.msec.perm.local >> /etc/security/msec/perm.local
       # exit



  Finally run the msec tool to check and implement your changes.


       $ su
       # msec
       # exit
       $



        [1mNOTE[22m: msec can only [4mreduce[24m the permissions of files, so if
  you don't get the results you expect, check that you're not asking
  msec to add missing permissions to the files or directories you
  created.
  [1m22.12.2.  Gentoo[0m

  The portage file for MythTV has scripts that will allow you to run
  mythbackend at startup.

  To run mythbackend as a daemon which starts at boot time:


       # rc-update add mythbackend default

  [1m22.13.  Advanced Backend Configurations[0m

  MythTV is flexible in the way that you define multiple backend tuner
  configurations.  The only hard-and-fast rule is that the Master
  backend [4mmust[24m have a capture device defined, but shouldn't imply that
  the capture device in the Master backend must be the first capture
  card defined in the database.

  One example of an advanced configuration is the round-robin scheme.
  Rather than defining all of the cards on the master, you could first
  go into setup on the master to define globals such as the general
  configuration and the channel lineup but not the host-specific
  configuration item like the capture card.  In this example, we will
  use a 4 tuner configuration, where two slaves have one card each and
  the master has two.

  1. Add the first capture card on one of the slaves.  Complete the
     configuration, connecting the input source to the card.  This will
     get cardid #1 in the database.  Exit setup.

  2. Configure the first capture card on the master backend.  This will
     get cardid #2 in the database.  Exit setup.

  3. Configure the first capture card on the second slave.  This will be
     cardid #3 in the database.  Exit setup.

  4. Configure the second capture card on the master backend.  This will
     get cardid #4 in the database.  Exit setup.

  Using this scheme, the master backend will not use both capture cards
  until one of the following happens:

  +o  There are four recordings scheduled for the same time

  +o  Both slaves are unavailable

  The scheduler in MythTV checks whether an encoder is available; if a
  slave backend isn't running, its encoder isn't available, so the
  scheduler will look for the next available encoder.  This makes MythTV
  very flexible; slave tuners can come and go, and as long as there are
  enough tuners for what you'd like to record it doesn't matter which
  tuner in particular is going to be used.

  Using this round-robin scheme along with a shared storage directory
  like NFS and enabling the Master Backend Override setting will allow
  you to view content even if the slave backend that recorded a program
  is not available.


  [1m22.14.  What is this transcoder thing, and how do I use it?[0m

  The transcoder re-encodes files from one MythTV format to another.
  The main purpose of the transcoder is to allow users with hardware
  encoders (PVR-250) or systems that can only record in RTjpeg due to
  performance reasons (multiple capture cards, slow system, etc) to
  create MPEG-4 streams to save space.

  The transcoder can be used in two ways:

  +o  Automatically re-encode every file once it has completed recording

  +o  After marking commercials, the transcoder can be run manually to
     delete the commercials from the file (thus further saving space)

     The two methods are independent.  The first is an automatic process
     that can be enabled/disabled through the setup program; the second
     is a manual method which must be invoked on each recording
     individually.

  The second method can be used on files that have already been
  transcoded (or files which were are already in the correct format), so
  only the frames immediately following a cut section will be re-
  encoded, resulting in a very minimal loss of quality.

  To enable automatic transcoding, do the following: start the setup
  program under the host-specific settings: set the Transcoder Auto-run
  checkbox

  For either manual or automatic transcoding: start mythbackend start
  mythfrontend select setup, and the Transcoding recording profile.  now
  select either RTjpeg or MPEG-4 (selecting any of the hardware encoders
  will result in the transcoder not working).  set the other parameters
  as you'd like.  For best performance, you should match the audio to
  the 'Default' profile.  If you plan to only use the manual transcoder,
  you can choose to set the video to be the same as the default profile
  too (as long as it is MPEG-4 or RTjpeg)

  Everything should now be setup properly.  If you elected to use the
  Auto-Run feature, the transcoder will automatically launch after each
  recording is complete.  The transcoder thread runs at a low priority,
  so it should not impact any critical tasks or other recordings.

  If you want to manually transcode a program, simply press 'X' while
  watching a recording (you should have already finished marking all
  commercials).  If you change your mind, hitting 'X' again will stop
  the transcoding.

  Once the transcode is complete, mythbackend will replace the old file
  with the new as soon as it is no longer in use.



  [1m22.15.  Changing your hostname[0m

  If you need to change the name of the computers used with MythTV
  you'll need to perform a sequence of steps.  There are a number of
  pieces of information that MythTV keeps track of which are tied to the
  hostname of the box, so changing the hostname involves altering the
  name in the operating system and in the MySQL database.  In the
  examples below, the old name of the system was "frontend1" and we're
  going to change it to "kidsroom".



    [1mNOTE[22m:  Changing the hostname using direct SQL update commands will
  break things.  You [4mMUST[24m use this indirect method.

  1.  Stop all backends.  If you run [1mmythbackend [22mfrom a terminal
  session, press control-c. If your backends are started with an init
  script, you would do something like the following:


       $ su
       # /etc/init.d/mythbackend stop



  2.  Change the hostname.

  For Red Hat and derived distributions, edit the /etc/sysconfig/network
  file.  Look for HOSTNAME=frontend1 and change this to
  HOSTNAME=kidsroom or whatever you'll be using.  For other
  distributions, refer to the documentation, such as the

  hostname(1)



  To alter the hostname in the current session, run:


       # hostname kidsroom



  3.  Dump the database.


       $ mysqldump -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg -c > mythtv_backup.sql



  4.  Rename the host in the database.  First, ensure that the new
  hostname you'll be using isn't already in the database.


       $ grep kidsroom mythtv_backup.sql



  Now we're actually going to change the name.  The following should all
  be typed on the same line:


       $ cat mythtv_backup.sql | sed s/\'frontend1\'/\'kidsroom\'/ >> mythtv_restore.sql



  If you don't feel comfortable using [1msed[22m, you can open the
  mythtv_backup.sql file in a text editor and perform a global search
  and replace.  When saving the file, make sure you use the new name,
  mythtv_restore.sql or the rest of the steps below will fail.

  5.  Drop and recreate the database.


       $ mysql -u root
       mysql>drop database mythconverg;
       mysql>create database mythconverg;
       mysql>exit



  6.  Restore the database using your edited version.


       $ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg < mythtv_restore.sql



  If you are running slave backends or frontends, don't forget to re-
  enable access as detailed in ``Modifying access to the MySQL database
  for multiple systems''.

  7.  Start the backends.  If you use init scripts, do the following,
  otherwise start them from terminal consoles.


       # /etc/init.d/mythbackend start



  8.  Quit and restart all frontends.  Delete the mythtv_backup.sql and
  mythtv_restore.sql files.


  [1m22.16.  Can I run MythTV on my TiVo?[0m

  [1m22.17.  Can I run MythTV on my ReplayTV?[0m

  No.

  While it is true that the TiVo runs the Linux kernel, and TiVo has
  released their changes to the kernel under the GPL, the TiVo is [4mnot[24m a
  general-purpose computer, and there is no programming information
  available for the custom hardware contained within a TiVo.  TiVo is
  under no obligation to release the source code to their [4mapplication[24m.

  The ReplayTV runs VxWorks, a Real Time Operating System from Wind
  River Systems.


  [1m22.18.  Can a wireless connection be used between the frontend and the[0m
  [1mbackend?[0m

  Yes, assuming that your wireless connection has sufficient bandwidth
  to maintain the datarate between the frontend and the backend.
  802.11b should be sufficient if the encoded bitrate of the content is
  less than the datarate of your wireless connection, which in the case
  of 802.11b would be approximately 4 Mbps.  (The advertised rate of
  11Mbps gives an actual throughput of 4 Mbps.) 802.11a and 802.11g, if
  operating in their high-speed modes, or proprietary 802.11b "Turbo"
  schemes should be adequate.  Multiple wireless frontends, poor signal
  strength or other factors can severely impact the viewing experience
  on the frontend.


  [1m22.19.  How can I burn shows that I have recorded to a DVD?[0m

  There are two answers to this question.  The easiest thing to do is to
  simply burn the MythTV files onto the DVD and treat the DVD as if it
  were a hard drive.  This will allow you to save the programs, but it's
  likely that they will [4mnot[24m be playable in a DVD player because the disc
  will simply contain files and not any DVD structure.  If you'd like to
  create a DVD that will play in a standard DVD player and your files
  have been recorded as MPEG-2 from a device supported by the IVTV
  driver, the first step you'll need to perform is to remux the file to
  make it DVD compliant.  Next, you'll use [1mdvdauthor[22m, [1mmkisofs [22mto create
  the ISO image, and finally [1mdvdrecord [22mto burn that to a blank DVD-R.

  The requirements for this procedure are [1mmjpegtools [22m(provides [1mmplex[22m)
  and [1mdvdauthor [22m(provides [1mmpeg2desc [22mand [1mdvdauthor[22m).

  This script will perform the necessary steps. You'll need to pass it
  the .nuv file and a name for the new DVD project.  You should end up
  with a directory which you can [1mmkisofs [22minto a ISO file then burn it.



       #!/bin/sh

       mkfifo aud0
       mkfifo vid0
       mkfifo dvdmpg

       mpeg2desc -a0 < $1 > aud0 &
       mpeg2desc -v0 < $1 > vid0 &
       mplex -f 8 -V -o dvdmpg aud0 vid0 &
       dvdauthor -o $2 -f dvdmpg
       dvdauthor -o $2 -T

       rm aud0
       rm vid0
       rm dvdmpg



  It's also possible to pipe the output of [1mmkisofs [22mdirectly to [1mcdrecord[0m
  without any intermediate files being written to your hard drive.  For
  example:


       #!/bin/sh
       TSIZE=`mkisofs -dvd-video -udf -q -print-size .`
       mkisofs -dvd-video -udf -V "$1" . | nice -10 cdrecord speed=1 dev=1,1,0 \
       driveropts=burnfree -dao -v tsize="$TSIZE"s -

  [1m22.20.  Burning a MythTV recording to a DVD (alternate version)[0m


  This is specific to MPEG-2 .nuv files created by Hauppauge PVR-X50
  video capture cards.

  The software packages you will want are:

  +o  dvd+rw-tools

  +o  dvdauthor

  +o  mjpegtools

  +o  avidemux2

  +o  transcode - not necessary for this, but useful for working with
     video

  +o  k3b - a GUI for burning DVD's and CD's.  Not necessary, but useful.

  1. Find the file you want.

  2. Run [1mavidemux2 [22mand open the .nuv file which corresponds with the
  program you wish to burn to DVD.

  3. Remove the segments you don't need.  Click twice on "A" when you
  are at the beginning of the segment you want to save, find the end of
  the segment, and click "B".

  4. Save the raw video stream and audio: File-> Save -> Save Raw Video
  Stream.  Save the file as 1.m2v.  When that's done, go to Audio ->
  Save Audio.  Save the file as 1.mp2

  5. Repeat steps 2 & 3 until you have saved all the segments you wish
  to keep.

  6.  Mplex the video and audio for each segment together in DVD-MPEG2
  format.  Do that by running

  mplex -f 8 -o 1.mpg 1.m2v 1.mp2

  7.  Create a DVD file system by running

  dvdauthor -o DVD 1.mpg 2.mpg ... n.mpg

  dvdauthor -T -o DVD

  8.  Put a blank DVD in your drive and write the video by running

  growisofs -Z /dev/scd0 -dvd-video DVD

  9.  Be sure and check the DVD in a player and then delete all the
  files you created in this process.

  Notes:

  You can reduce the size of your files and fit more video on a DVD by
  using [1mtcrequant[22m, which is part of [1mtranscode[22m.

  The steps above create a DVD that starts playing the video
  automatically. If you want to burn a DVD with menus and multiple video
  titles, see the next section.



  [1m22.21.  Creating a DVD with Menus[0m

  This assumes that you have already formatted the videos in a DVD-
  compliant format that works with [1mdvdauthor[22m.


  [1m22.21.1.  CREATING A MENU[0m

  This is potentially the most difficult step in creating a DVD with a
  menu.  You must capture or create a background image with the
  appropriate resolution and [1mmplex [22mit together with an audio file
  (typically silence, although though you may use sound) and then create
  overlay images that show


  1. the menu text

  2. the highlighted buttons

  3. the selected buttons

  You would then use [1mspumux [22mto combine the background video with the
  overlay menus.

  The background image must be saved as a JPG and the overlay images
  must be PNG with a maximum of three colors.  Four colors are allowed,
  but the transparent background counts as one of the available colors.
  In these examples, the background file is called menu.jpg, the menu
  text is called menu1.png and the highlighted and selected buttons are
  the same and called menu2.png.



  [1m22.21.1.1.  Create a Background[0m

  To get a background image, use [1mavidemux2 [22mand find the frame you wish
  to use as a background image.  Save the frame as menu.jpg by executing
  File -> Save -> Save JPG Image.

  You may also create your own background image in the GIMP.  Use the
  following settings:

  For NTSC Video:


       width: 720
       height: 480
       x-axis: 81dpi
       y-axis: 72dpi



  [1m22.21.1.2.  Convert the background JPG file into a M2V video file[0m

  jpeg2yuv -n 50 -I p -f 29.97 -j menu.jpg | mpeg2enc -n n -f 8 -o
  menu.m2v

  For PAL Video



  width: 720
  height: 576
  x-axis: 75dpi
  y-axis: 80dpi



  [1m22.21.1.3.  Convert the background JPG file into a M2V video file[0m

  jpeg2yuv -n 50 -I p -f 25 -j menu.jpg | mpeg2enc -n p -f 8 -o menu.m2v


  [1m22.21.1.4.  Merge the background you just created with audio[0m

  You will need some sort of audio to [1mmplex [22mwith the M2V file you just
  created, so either capture some audio using [1mavidemux2 [22mor another
  program, or to create empty audio to [1mmplex[22m, use this command

  dd if=/dev/zero bs=4 count=2000 | toolame -b 128 -s 48 /dev/stdin
  menu.mp2


  [1m22.21.1.5.  Merge the M2V video with the MP2 audio[0m

  mplex -f 8 -o menu.mpg menu.m2v menu.mp2


  [1m22.21.1.6.  Create the menu buttons[0m


  Open the background menu.jpg file in the GIMP.  Add a transparent
  layer over the background and mark where you will want the different
  buttons to be located.  This layer will later be deleted, so it
  doesn't have to be clean.  When creating this layer, use all the
  colors you want to use in your buttons.  Remember, no more than three
  colors.

  Delete the Background layer.

  Change the image to an indexed color mode.  Do this by right-clicking
  on the image and selecting Image -> Mode -> Indexed.  Enter "4" in the
  number of colors.

  Create two new layers.

  In the top layer, you will enter the text for your buttons.  Select
  the color you want for your text either in the color palette or by
  using the Color Picker Tool.  To use the Color Picker, you must make
  sure you have that bottom layer selected.  Enter the text for all the
  buttons on the top layer according to whatever layout you decided on.

  Now you will create the actual buttons by drawing boxes around the
  text and filling that area with the Color Fill Tool.  Be sure and
  select the color you want (contrasting to the text) and to create your
  boxes in the second from the top layer.

  Delete that bottom layer which we stated earlier would be deleted.

  Save the current image as menu2.png.  Do that by right-clicking and
  selecting File -> Save as, and make the name menu.png.  Click "Export"
  and make sure that "Save Background Color" and "Save Resolution" are
  selected.


  Select the bottom layer and change the Opacity to 0%.  Now save the
  image as menu1.png.


  [1m22.21.1.7.  Create the final menu video[0m

  To create the DVD menu, an XML file is used.  An example menu.xml file
  is shown below.  The autoorder line is used to decide what takes
  precedent for ordering.  If your buttons are ordered primarily by
  rows, then select "rows".  If your ordering is by column, then choose
  "columns".



       ###begin menu.xml###
       <subpictures>
         <stream>
           <spu
            force="yes"
            start="00:00:00.00"
            image="menu1.png"
            select="menu2.png"
            highlight="menu2.png"
            autooutline="infer"
            outlinewidth="6"
            autoorder="rows"
           >
           </spu>
         </stream>
       </subpictures>
       ###end menu.xml###



  Then create the final menu with

  spumux menu.xml < menu.mpg > menu_final.mpg

  You should see some lines in the output to the console that show

  INFO:  Autodetect ...

  The number of these lines that you see should be the same number of
  buttons you created.  If there are, then good job!



  [1m22.21.2.  Authoring the DVD[0m

  To create the DVD structure, an XML file is used.  The below file is
  an example dvd.xml file.  This example file allows for the 4 buttons
  in the menu created earlier and has three video segments making up
  each of the 4 video titles.  Each of the separate video segments will
  be treated as separate chapters of one consistent video title.

  [1m22.22.  Using the DBoxII within MythTV[0m

  The configuration of the DBoxII for use within MythTV is tricky (as of
  May 16 2005), that's why it's covered here. Your DBoxII has to be
  running linux and the Neutrino GUI instead of the stock BetaNova
  firmware.  For further information, please refer to
  http://www.tuxbox.org <http://www.tuxbox.org>. Additionally, you need
  to enable the SPTS mode in Neutrino.

  1.) Add a new "Capture Card" in the setup. The "Card type" is "DBOX2
  Input", the other values have to be adjusted according to your setup.
  The default values, except for the "DBOX2 host ip", should work fine.
  2.) Define a new video source. It doesn't need to be configured, you
  just need to define it. MythTV grabs the EPG from the DBoxII.  3.)
  Connect the DBoxII to the newly defined input source in "input
  connections".  4.) Since channel scanning is not implemented yet, you
  need to define channels in the "Channel Editor". Make sure that you
  use the same value for "Channel Name" as on the DBoxII. You can get a
  list of available channels from the web interface of Neutrino at
  http://ip-of-your-box:80/.  Associate the channel with your new video
  source and repeat when needed.

  You may leave the Setup now and proceed as usual.


  [1m22.23.  Migrating from XMLTV to DataDirect[0m

  DataDirect will use different information for your video sources and
  channels than was used by XMLTV. The following will clear your old
  information in a way that will allow your EPG and existing recording
  rules to continue to work as you'd expect.

  The first step is to create a backup of your database using the
  instructions found in ``Saving or restoring the database''

  [1mNOTE[22m: Examine the contents of the backup file to be sure that the
  backup succeeded before modifying your database.

  [1mNOTE[22m: The MythTV DataDirect grabber requires [1mwget [22mversion 1.9.1 or
  later. Verify that this is installed before modifying your database.

  Next, start [1mmysql [22mand perform the following commands:


       $ mysql -u root mythconverg
       mysql>CREATE TABLE channel_copy SELECT * FROM channel;
       mysql>exit
       $



  Run the MythTV setup program.  When the setup program prompts "Would
  you like to clear all program/channel settings before starting
  configuration [no]" type "yes".

  Complete the configuration as detailed in the section called
  ``Configuring the Zap2It.com DataDirect service'' and in ``Video
  Sources''.
    You [4mmust[24m associate your DataDirect information with the inputs on
  your capture device.  If you created "Cable-DD", then don't forget to
  bind /dev/video0 to Cable-DD in the ``Video Sources'' portion of
  setup.

  Once you're done running setup, run [1mmythfilldatabase [22mto populate the
  database with new data.

  To restore the channel icons, you will need to perform one of two
  steps.  Both are dependant on the channel_copy table you created
  above.

  If you're running MySQL v3, execute the following.  Note that the
  select command is very long.  You can press ENTER at the end of each
  line; the command won't be evaluated until you end the statement with
  a semicolon.


       $ mysql -u root mythconverg
       mysql>create table channel_temp
       select c.chanid, c.channum, c.sourceid, c.callsign, c.name, cb.icon,
       c.finetune, c.videofilters, c.xmltvid, c.contrast, c.brightness,
       c.colour, c.freqid, c.recpriority, c.hue, c.tvformat,
       c.commfree, c.visible, c.outputfilters
       from channel c
       left join channel_copy cb on (c.callsign = cb.callsign);
       mysql>truncate channel;
       mysql>insert channel select * from channel_temp;
       mysql>drop table channel_temp;
       mysql>drop table channel_copy;
       mysql>exit
       $



  If you are running MySQL v4, it's a little simpler. The next command
  is one long string:


       $ mysql -u root mythconverg
       mysql>UPDATE channel,channel_copy SET channel.icon = channel_copy.icon
       WHERE channel.callsign = channel_copy.callsign;
       mysql>drop table channel_copy;
       mysql>exit
       $



  [1m22.24.  What do the icons on the Watch Recordings screen mean?[0m

  Press "1" or F1 to get a popup.

  [1m22.25.  What is the difference between a PVR-250 and a PVR-350[0m

  This is covered in the hardware section, and extensively covered on
  the Hauppauge website.  Briefly recapping:

  A PVR-250 (model 980) is primarily a MPEG-2 encoder.  It has a tuner,
  composite and SVideo connection for video, and an 1/8" audio jack for
  stereo analog audio.  It also has an IR receiver and comes with a
  remote control.

  The PVR-250 MCE (Media Center Edition, aka model 975)) contains a FM
  radio tuner.  The tuner is currently not support by MythTV.  The
  PVR-250 MCE does not contain a IR receiver or a remote.

  The PVR-250 Rev 1 contained an MPEG-2 decoder.  However, this function
  was not connected to any output jacks, and there doesn't appear to be
  any way to pull decoded video from the card, so it's a fairly useless
  feature.

  The PVR-350 (model 990) has the features of the PVR-250 as well as
  being able to decode MPEG-2.  The encode and decode functions may be
  used simultaneously.  The MPEG-2 decoder function gives superior video
  quality.  However, the decoder function is only available once Linux
  has started, so you will not see any boot-time messages.

  Also, the card does not support any 3D functions, making it a poor
  gamer card.

  Non-MPEG-2 content will be displayed on the PVR-350 output using
  framebuffer features, placing a large load on the host CPU.

  Note that for the PVR-350 there are some ``considerations'' regarding
  the way audio is handled.


  [1m22.26.  Changing channels on an external Set Top Box[0m

  If you need to use an external Set Top Box (STB), such as for
  satellite TV or for digital cable you will need some way for MythTV to
  tell the STB to switch to a new channel.  There are several methods:

  1. Use an IR blaster.  An IR blaster is an infrared transmitter
     connected to your computer.  When MythTV needs to change channels
     it will send IR pulses, thereby emulating a remote control.

  2. Use a direct serial connection.  Some STB's have a serial port on
     the back, although it may not look like a serial port.  It may look
     like a phone jack, or a strange VGA connector.  It may be labeled
     "Low Speed Data".  A direct serial connection is more reliable than
     an IR blaster.  Not all STB's that have a Low Speed Data port have
     it enabled; you may need to convince your service provider to turn
     it on.  Stating that you have a Tivo may help; the Tivo has a
     direct-connect capability.

  3. Use a firewire connection.  There is a 6200ch.c in the MythTV
     contrib directory which may work for you.

  [1m22.27.  Configuring one machine to flag all commercials[0m

  Commercial flagging can be CPU intensive.  By default, the backend
  that created a recording is the one which will flag commercials.  You
  may wish to use a different machine to run commercial flagging.

  On the slower machine:

  Start the backend setup program.  Advance through the pages until you
  get to the Job Queue page.  Turn off the setting that says "Allow
  Commercial Detection jobs", thereby preventing any commercial flagging
  jobs from running on this machine.

  Next, make sure that "Run Jobs only on original recording host" is
  turned OFF so that new jobs are allowed to run anywhere.

  Restart [1mmythbackend [22msince it only reads this setting when it starts
  up.

  On the faster machine:

  Start the backend setup program.  Advance through the pages until you
  get to the Job Queue page.  Ensure that "Allow Commercial Detection
  jobs" is turned ON for this machine.

  Run [1mmythjobqueue[22m.  [1mmythjobqueue [22mwill examine the JobQueue and run any
  jobs it finds.  [1mmythjobqueue [22mshould be left running so that it will
  pick up any new commercial flagging jobs that are added to the queue,
  otherwise new jobs will be added to the queue and your programs won't
  be flagged until you run manually run [1mmythjobqueue[22m.


  [1m23.  Example Configurations.[0m

  This section contains configurations which you may find useful.

  [1m23.1.  Hauppauge PVR-250/350 hardware MPEG-2 encoder[0m



       [1mNOTE[22m:  THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED AS-IS AND IS
  NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK WITH YOUR DISTRIBUTION.  FOR IVTV DRIVER
  ASSISTANCE, SEE THE IVTV MAILING LIST.
  https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ivtv-devel
  <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ivtv-devel>  SEE THE
  IVTV FAQ IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR ISSUES.
  http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/ <http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/> These
  instructions work for Mandrake 9.1 on a backend machine which is
  hosting a single PVR-250 capture card.

  Install the Mandrake kernel source.  If you are using a different
  Mandrake kernel level (i.e. not 2.4.21-0.16mdk as in the example
  below, then alter the [1murpmi [22mcommand appropriately.)


       $ uname -a
       Linux pvr 2.4.21-0.16mdk #1 Fri Apr 11 06:51:54 CEST 2003 i686 unknown
       unknown GNU/Linux

       $ su
       # urpmi kernel-source



             [1mNOTE[22m:  You do not need to recompile your kernel.
  Download the latest IVTV driver from Sourceforge.  Check
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/ivtv/
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/ivtv/> for the current version.
  Right now (2004-01-21), it's 0.1.9.  Untar the file.


       $ tar -xzf ivtv-0.1.9.tar.gz



  This should create an ivtv directory.  Switch to it and perform the
  following commands:
       $ cd ivtv/utils
       $ wget http://hauppauge.lightpath.net/software/pvr250/pvr250_17_21288.exe
       $ su
       # ./ivtvfwextract.pl pvr250_17_21288.exe
       # exit
       $ cd ../driver



  The [1mivtvfwextract [22mprogram extracts the firmware required for the card.
  You may want to go to the Hauppauge website and download the latest
  Windows driver if the [1mwget [22mcommand fails.

  ivtv also needs to know how your kernel was compiled.  The default
  Makefile is not configured for the way Mandrake "does things".  At the
  top of the Makefile in the driver directory is a line like this:


       KERNELDIR= /lib/modules/$(KERNVER)/build



  edit it so that it looks like:


       KERNELDIR= /usr/src/linux



     [1mNOTE[22m:  If you are running a distribution / kernel which is using
  the new version of i2c (version 2.8.x, found in the latest Mandrake
  and Cooker) you will need to make the following edit. Look for


       # uncomment if you use i2c 2.8.0+
       #CFLAGS += -DNEW_I2C



  and remove the "#" from the line containing CFLAGS.

  Next, compile the driver:


       $ cd ~/ivtv/driver
       $ make



  Compile the [1mtest_ioctl [22mprogram:



  $ cd ../utils
  $ make
  $ su
  # cp test_ioctl /usr/local/bin
  # exit



     [1mNOTE[22m: You may get warnings about i2c during the compile.  Ignore
  them if they look something like this: #warning Using temporary hack
  for missing I2C driver-ID for saa7114

  However, if you get an actual compile error where the compile doesn't
  finish and the error looks like: saa7115.c:1117: error: unknown field
  'inc_use' specified in initializer then you didn't uncomment CFLAGS as
  specified ``above''.

  Add the following to /etc/modules.conf:



        [1mNOTE[22m:  You do not need to add the last line "add above..."
  if you will not be using the IR remote that came with the card.


       alias char-major-81     videodev
       alias char-major-81-0   ivtv
       alias char-major-61 lirc_i2c
       options ivtv debug=1
       options tuner type=2
       options msp3400 once=1 simple=1
       add below ivtv msp3400 saa7115 tuner
       add above ivtv lirc_dev lirc_i2c



          [1mNOTE[22m:  You must specify the tuner type manually.  See
  ~/ivtv/driver/tuner.h for a listing of tuners.  In the above example,
  tuner type=2 is a Phillips NTSC.  Use an appropriate tuner type for
  your system and video standard.  The debug=1 parameter on the ivtv
  line actually means less debugging output will be printed.  At this
  point we need to ensure that there are no other versions of msp3400.o
  that would be loaded instead of the version that is created by ivtv.
  Note that in the command below we are using the backtick, usually
  located on the same key as the tilde " " and not the single quote.



  $ su
  # cd /lib/modules/`uname -r`
  # pwd
  /lib/modules/2.4.21-0.16mdk
  # find . -name "msp3400*" | xargs rm -f



  Next, copy the files that were compiled in the driver directory into
  the appropriate modules directory:


       $ su
       # make install
       # depmod -ae



  Finally, load the ivtv driver:


       # modprobe ivtv
       # exit



  Check that the card is being recognized on the PCI bus:


       $ lspci -v
       <snip>

       00:0c.0 Multimedia video controller: Internext Compression Inc iTVC15 MPEG-2
       Encoder (rev 01)
               Subsystem: Hauppauge computer works Inc.: Unknown device 4801
               Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 11
               Memory at d0000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=64M]
               Capabilities: <available only to root>



  If you don't see your card on the PCI bus, make sure that it's been
  installed in a bus-master slot.  For some motherboards, only the PCI
  slots closest to the AGP slot are bus-mastering.

  Check that the ivtv driver has created a new video device:


       $ ls -l /dev/v4l/vi*
       crw-------    1 mythtv   sys       81, 224 Dec 31  1969 vbi0
       crw-------    1 mythtv   sys       81,   0 Dec 31  1969 video0
       crw-------    1 mythtv   sys       81,  32 Dec 31  1969 video32



  In this case, the ivtv device is video0.

  You can now add this card available to MythTV.  Go into your mythtv
  setup directory on the machine hosting the hardware MPEG-2 card.  When
  you add a new capture card, ensure that you are using the video0
  device.
     [1mNOTE[22m:  As of 2003-04-25 the ivtv driver does not support VBI, so
  closed-captioning is not available.  Leave the VBI device, audio
  device and audio sampling rate limit at the default values.  Change
  the default input to an appropriate setting for your configuration.
  Change the card type to "Hardware MPEG Encoder Card" and press ENTER.

  The remaining setup is just like a standard V4L card; define a video
  source if you have not already done so, and assign the video source to
  a video card input on the Input Connections screen.

  Some people report issues with the ivtv module not being loaded when
  required by MythTV.  To get around this, you can [1mmodprobe [22mthe ivtv
  driver before using it.  The simplest technique is to add the [1mmodprobe[0m
  command to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:


       # echo "/sbin/modprobe ivtv" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local



                       [1mNOTE[22m:  some people complain
  that their PVR-250/350 card is not capturing audio.  The most likely
  source for this is that your system is not loading the correct
  msp3400.o file; ivtv uses a custom msp3400.c, and if the resulting
  module isn't loaded you will not get sound.  Switch to your
  /lib/modules directory and rename the existing msp3400.o file, then
  copy the msp3400.o from the ivtv driver directory and re-run [1mdepmod[22m.
  If that still doesn't work, then check the ivtv mailing list for more
  information.  You may wish to perform an [1mupdatedb [22mas root and then do
  a locate msp3400 to find all the msp3400.o.gz files that may be on
  your system.  For example, Mandrake has a msp3400.o.gz in the 3rdparty
  subdirectory which will take precedence over the custom version
  created by ivtv.  You can check if you have the correct msp3400 loaded
  by typing (as root): modinfo msp3400 | grep "parm: *standard".  If you
  don't get a line that says: "parm:        standard int", then you're
  not loading the correct msp3400.  Check to ensure that you're loading
  the correct msp3400 module.



       # modinfo msp3400
       filename:    /lib/modules/2.4.22-9mdk/kernel/drivers/media/video/msp3400.o



  Check that the path is correct for your kernel version, and that the
  driver being loaded is in /media/video and not some other directory.



     [1mNOTE[22m:  Some people report "ghosting" issues with their PVR-250s,
  where there is a faint copy of whatever is on the screen appearing to
  the right of the image.  If you have this issue, it's fairly obvious.
  This is a firmware issue, apparently.  There are two ways around this:

  1. Run at 720x480 resolution

  2. Turn off DNR

  To turn off DNR, add the following to your rc.local:


       /path/to/ivtv/utils/test_ioctl --set-codec-params=dnr_mode=0,dnr_temporal=0



  [1m23.2.  Logical Volume Manager (LVM)[0m

  LVM greatly increases the flexibility you have in managing your
  storage than traditional physical partitions. This section will
  provide some brief notes on how to use LVM to create storage space for
  your video files and how to add additional disk space in the future.
  There's lots more that can be done with LVM, so check the LVM HOWTO
  http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/ <http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/>
  document for details.

  If you don't understand how to partition a drive, or how to change the
  partition type you should stop and look at documentation on how to
  perform these steps.



    [1mBIG FAT WARNING[22m:  Using an incorrect parameter can make your files
  inaccessible, prevent your computer from booting, etc.  Be careful!

  Make sure your kernel configuration includes LVM support or that it's
  available as a module. Today, most vendors include this by default.
  You'll also want to ensure that you have a copy of the LVM utilities;
  check your distribution, or get the latest versions from
  http://www.sistina.com/products_lvm.htm
  <http://www.sistina.com/products_lvm.htm> and build them manually.

  Check that the [1mvgscan [22mprogram is being run at some point during your
  boot sequence - most distributions do this by default. Look for a
  message during boot up that looks like this: vgscan -- reading all
  physical volumes (this may take a while...) If you don't see any
  messages during boot, you may need to install a LVM init script or
  confirm that you have all of the LVM packages installed from your
  distribution.

  LVM uses a few concepts you should be familiar with before starting.

  +o  PV (Physical Volume).  The actual partition on the hard drive.

  +o  VG (Volume Group).  The aggregation of all the PVs make a VG.

  +o  LV (Logical Volume).  Subdivision of the pool of space available in
     the VG into individual chunks, like /usr, /var/video, etc.

  The following example assumes that you want to create a LVM partition
  from a chunk of space in /dev/hda5, using a reiserfs filesystem and
  mounted on /var/video. You later decide to extend this filesystem by
  adding a new disk: /dev/hdb.

  You need to create at least one LVM partition for a physical volume.
  Use [1mfdisk [22mor your favorite partition editor to set the type to LVM
  (0x8e). If you're using an entire disk, create one big partition
  rather than using the device itself. e.g. use /dev/hdb1 not /dev/hdb.

  In the following example, you have a 15GB disk.  The first 6GB are set
  as your boot partition.  /dev/hda2 was added as an extended partition,
  and within that partition you created the /dev/hda5 linux (ext2)
  partition.



       # fdisk /dev/hda

       The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 1823.
       There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
       and could in certain setups cause problems with:
       1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
       2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
          (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)

  Create the LVM physical volume from the partitions (repeat if you have
  multiple partitions to use):


       # pvcreate /dev/hda5



  Create a LVM volume group out of this physical volume called
  "VGforMyth" that is allocated in chunks that are a multiple of 64MB



  # vgcreate VGforMyth -s 64m /dev/hda5



  Create a logical volume of 5GB called "video" and then create the
  reiserfs filesystem and mount it:


       # lvcreate --name video --size 5G VGforMyth
       # mkreiserfs /dev/VGforMyth/video
       # mount /dev/VGforMyth/video /var/video



  Now create a 3GB volume for mythmusic files if you like:


       # lvcreate --name music --size 3G VGforMyth
       # mkreiserfs /dev/VGforMyth/music
       # mount /dev/VGforMyth/music /var/music



  Display the volume group status: # vgdisplay -v

  Now, lets suppose you want to add a 60GB hard disk to the system as
  hdb and allocate 50GB of it to video storage.

  First, create a single partition /dev/hdb1 covering the whole disk and
  make it type 0x8e using your partition editor.

  # fdisk /dev/hdb .... create partition, set type, save and reboot if
  it says you have to

  Create the new LVM physical volume:

  # pvcreate /dev/hdb1

  Add the new physical volume to the volume group:

  # vgextend VGforMyth /dev/hdb1



    [1mNOTE[22m:  You may get errors at this point stating that there are no
  physical volumes available for adding to the LV, even though you know
  for a fact that there are.  You may need to specify the physical
  volume in the /dev/ide/host/bus/target/lun/etc format.  Once you've
  completed one of the following two procedures, use [1mdf [22mto check that
  you've got more space.


  [1m23.2.1.  ReiserFS[0m

  Make the logical volume used for video bigger:

  # lvextend --size +50G /dev/VGforMyth/video

  Unmount, resize and remount the filesystem.  Technically, you don't
  need to unmount and remount the ReiserFS.
       # umount /var/video
       # resize_reiserfs /dev/VGforMyth/video
       # mount /dev/VGforMyth/video /var/video



  [1m23.2.2.  ext2 or ext3[0m

  LVM comes with a program called [1me2fsadm[22m.

  Unmount, resize and remount the filesystem.  The filesystem [4mmust[24m be
  unmounted during this procedure.


       # umount /var/video
       # e2fsadm --size +50G /dev/VGforMyth/video
       # mount /dev/VGforMyth/video /var/video



  [1m23.3.  Advanced Partition Formatting[0m

  The partitions that your distribution sets up for you may not be
  optimized for large files. Using LVM in conjunction with the following
  techniques can be quite useful.

  Unlike a typical filesystem, a MythTV video partition is usually a
  very large filesystem filled with a fairly small number of large
  files.  Filesystem I/O is usually not an issue, even in multi-tuner
  and/or multi-frontend setups.

  There is however, one aspect of filesystem performance that can have a
  bearing on the performance of MythTV.  In Linux, deleting a file will
  utilize I/O bandwidth until the deletion has been completed.  If
  deleting the file takes long enough, the video capture buffer may
  overrun, thereby resulting in dropped frames.  Some filesystems are
  faster at deleting files than others and, for multi-gigabyte MythTV
  video files, these differences can be significant.

  Fortunately, there are published tests
  (http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html
  <http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html>) that provide
  insight into filesystem performance under conditions relevant to
  MythTV usage.  In addition, some limited testing (archived at
  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/users/52672
  <http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/users/52672>) with very
  large files (10 gigabytes) was reported in the MythTV Users mailing
  list.


  [1m23.3.1.  Ext2[0m

  Ext2 was the defacto standard Linux filesystem for many years.  It is
  stable, provides good I/O performance and can quickly delete large
  files.  The primary disadvantage of Ext2 is that it is not a
  journaling filesystem, so a file system consistency check (fsck, which
  is normally only performed after a system crash) can take many hours
  on a filesystem the size of a typical MythTV partition.



  [1m23.3.2.  Ext3[0m

  Ext3 is Ext2 with a journal, so your biggest gain is that in case of a
  crash and reboot you won't have to wait very long for your partition
  to be remounted.

  There are options available when formatting an Ext3 partition, as in:


       # mkfs.ext3 -T largefile4 /dev/hdb1



  This example assumes that /dev/hdb1 has already been created using
  [1mfdisk[22m. If you're using LVM, /dev/hdb1 may be something like
  /dev/VGforMyth/video.

  The "-T largefile4" option creates one inode per 4 megabytes, which
  can provide a few percent more storage space.  However, tests indicate
  that using the "-T largefile4" option can drastically increase the
  amount of time required to delete a large file and thus it should only
  be used with encoder settings that produce small video files (YMMV).

  You can check on your filesystem using the [1mdumpe2fs [22mprogram. See the
  man page for details.

  [1m23.3.3.  ReiserFS[0m

  The Reiser filesystem is another journaling filesystem commonly
  distributed with Linux.  It is known to be an extremely efficient
  filesystem and it especially excels at managing partitions containing
  a large number of small files.  However, tests indicate it is not the
  fastest at deleting very large files.  For that reason, it may not be
  the best choice when using encoder bitrates that produce very large
  files.


  [1m23.3.4.  JFS[0m

  JFS (Journaling File System) is a journaling filesystem originally
  developed by IBM for AIX which was later released as open source.
  While not as common as Ext3 or ReiserFS, it is distributed with RedHat
  9 (RH9) and Fedora Core 1 (RHFC1) and Mandrake as well as other
  distros.  According to tests, JFS is the file deletion speed king,
  deleting virtually any file in under one second, even files as large
  as 10 gigabytes.


  [1m23.3.5.  XFS[0m

  XFS is a journaling file system originally developed by SGI for Irix,
  and later released as open source.  While not a part of the default
  RedHat Linux 9 or Fedora Core installation (although it is a part of
  Mandrake and Fedora Core 2), it can be easily installed via ATrpms.
  XFS provides deletion speeds for large files only slightly slower than
  JFS.  According to the test results shown at
  (http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html
  <http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html>), XFS provide
  higher I/O rates than JFS, albeit at a higher CPU loading.  This may
  cause issues if you do not have the spare CPU capacity to handle XFS,
  potentially leading to dropped frames.



  [1m23.4.  HDTV with the Air2PC-ATSC-PCI card[0m

  The Air2PC card has the capability to capture over-the-air HDTV
  signals (8VSB).  The Air2PC card is installed as a DVB device and is
  supported within MythTV.

  First, you must compile a version of the Linux kernel to support the
  new tuner device.

  Download the source to 2.6.11.


       $ su
       # cd /usr/src
       # wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.11.tar.bz2
       # tar -xjf linux-2.6.11.tar.bz2
       # pushd .



  If you already have a 2.6 kernel running, copy the .config file and
  use it as your starting point.  If not, then go straight to the make
  menuconfig portion below.

  On Debian with a 2.6.10 kernel:



       # cp /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/.config .
       # make oldconfig



  Read the prompts that come up; for the most part you should be able to
  answer "No".


       # make menuconfig



  For Gentoo:


       # emerge genkernel udev hotplug coldplug
       # genkernel --menuconfig --udev --save-config all



  Go to the Device Drivers->Multimedia->Digital Video Broadcasting
  Devices

  Enable DVB for Linux and select B2C2/Technisat Air/Sky/CableStar 2
  PCI.

  Exit menuconfig, then compile modules and the kernel.  (Gentoo will do
  this automatically as a part of the [1mgenkernel [22mstep.



  # make modules
  # make
  # make install modules_install



  Make any modifications necessary to your boot configuration files
  (lilo or grub) as required to boot your new kernel.

  Download and compile the dvb applications you'll need to configure the
  card.  At the password prompt, press ENTER.


       $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@linuxtv.org:/cvs/linuxtv login
       $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@linuxtv.org:/cvs/linuxtv co dvb-apps dvb-kernel
       $ cd dvb-apps
       $ make



  [1mNOTE[22m: As of 2005-02-16, the compile aborts with an error, however not
  before the [1mazap [22mis compiled, so you should be able to continue.


       $ su
       # cp utils/szap/azap /usr/local/bin



  On Gentoo, execute the following:


       # mkdir /lib/firmware
       # cp ~/dvb-kernel/firmware/dvb-fe-nxt2002.fw /lib/firmware
       # echo skystar2 >> /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6
       # exit



  On Debian:


       # cp ~/dvb-kernel/firmware/dvb-fe-nxt2002.fw /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware
       # exit



  Shutdown your machine, install the card and restart.  Ensure that
  you're using your newly compiled kernel.

  Once you've rebooted, confirm that the card is detected.  If you type
  [1mdmesg[22m, you should see something like this:


       drivers/media/dvb/b2c2/skystar2.c: FlexCopIIB(rev.195) chip found
       drivers/media/dvb/b2c2/skystar2.c: the chip has 38 hardware filters
       DVB: registering new adapter (SkyStar2).
       DVB: registering frontend 0 (Nextwave nxt2002 VSB/QAM frontend)...



  If you are using 8VSB (Over-the-Air HDTV), run the [1mazap [22mprogram.
  Replace ZIPCODE with your zip code.  The perl script will connect to
  http://www.antennaweb.org <http://www.antennaweb.org> to obtain your
  HDTV channels.

       $



  [1mNOTE[22m: if you have anything in the unc column ("uncorrectable errors")
  you will probably have problems with HDTV.  Check your antenna,
  cables, etc.

  Once you have confirmed that your card is able to lock onto a HDTV
  signal it is time to configure MythTV. Start the setup program, and in
  the Capture Cards section change the card type to "Digital Video
  Broadcast".

  For HDTV you do not need to use the Advanced configuration.

  [1m23.5.  Diskless Ubuntu[0m

  (This information is a work in progress - 2005-07-15.)

  In the following examples, we are going to create an environment which
  can be used to boot a diskless workstation using PXE.

  There are two machines in this scenario:  the backend, a Debian Sarge
  system which has the disks and which will run the necessary support
  software, and the "basement" machine, an Intel D865PERL motherboard
  with 512MB of DRAM, a NVidia 440MX video card, a Microsoft MCE USB
  remote and a HD44780 16x2 Vacuum Fluorescent Display.


  [1m23.5.1.  Backend Configuration[0m

  The backend machine needs to provide the support software for the
  services needed to boot a diskless workstation.



       $ su
       # apt-get install dhcpd3-server atftpd syslinux


       # mkdir -p /nfsroot/basement
       # debootstrap --arch i386 hoary /nfsroot/basement/ http://archive.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu



  http://archive.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/dists/warty/main/installer-
  i386/current/doc/manual/en/apcs03.html

  Once that's done, we'll need to [1mchroot [22minto the newly created
  directory structure for some initial setup.


       $ su
       # chroot /nfsroot/basement



  Set the hostname that you'd like this machine to display at login and
  at the shell:


       # echo "basement" > /etc/hostname



  Add the IP address of this host to /etc/hosts


       # echo "127.0.0.1 localhost" >> /etc/hosts
       # echo "192.168.10.51 backend-2" >> /etc/hosts



  Create the initial configuration:


       /usr/sbin/base-config new



  Create a xorg.conf file:


       # xorgconfig



  Edit your /etc/apt/sources.list and look at the bottom of the file.
