  Initially, installation of mythtv seems like a huge task.  There are
  lots of dependencies, and various distributions seem to do the same
  thing different ways.  This document will attempt to give general
  installation instructions, as well as including distribution-specific
  instructions where necessary.

  [1m2.1.  Hardware.[0m

  mythtv is a software video encoder, which means that it uses a fairly
  generic "dumb" video capture card, encodes the frames of video using
  the CPU on your motherboard and writes them to disk.  High-end video
  capture cards and devices like the Tivo and RePlay have dedicated
  encoder chips on them which use specialized hardware to convert the
  video stream to the MPEG-2 format without using the motherboard CPU,
  which means that the main CPU only has to worry about running the
  Operating System and reading and writing to the disk.  These have
  fairly low CPU requirements compared to encoding video.

  There are many variables that go into the question: "How fast a CPU do
  I need to run mythtv"?  Obviously, the faster your CPU, the better
  your experience will be with mythtv.  Performing the "Watch TV"
  function, where the CPU is both encoding and decoding video
  simultaneously to allow Pause, Fast Forward and Rewind functions for
  live TV requires twice as much CPU as just encoding or decoding.
  mythtv also supports multiple encoder cards in a single PC, increasing
  the CPU requirements if you are going to simultaneously encode
  multiple programs.

  Here are a few data points:

  +o  A PIII/733Mhz system can encode one video stream using the RTJPEG
     codec using 512x480 capture resolution.  This does not allow for
     live TV watching, but does allow for encoding video and then
     watching it later.

  +o  The developer states that his AMD1800+ system can [1malmost [22mencode two
     MPEG4 video streams and watch one program simultaneously.


  [1m2.2.  Software.[0m

  There are a few ways of installing programs on Linux systems; you can
  either use the graphical tools, or command-line utilities.  Either
  system will get the job done, and it all depends on your comfort level
  with Linux.

  In order to compile mythtv, we need to make sure that the software it
  needs is installed.  As of 2002-11-08, this list includes perl-5.8,
  mysql, gcc, freetype2-devel and qt-devel.  If you're going to use a
  remote control with mythtv, you're going to need the cdialog package
  in order to compile lircd.
  [1m2.2.1.  Graphical installation tools.[0m

  On systems running KDE, a tool which will allow you to see what
  packages are available and if they're installed on your system can be
  accessed by clicking K->Configuration->Packaging->KPackage

  There are many inter-related modules, so make sure that you've got the
  main package for each one, and not a sub package for an unrelated
  item.  For example, there are many modules that have "perl" in them;
  some are a part of the apache web server, others are a part of the
  perl distribution.  In each case, we're looking to make sure that the
  primary module is getting installed.

  Click the magnifying glass or press [1mCTRL-F [22mand enter "perl" as your
  search term.  You should find it under the "Perl" folder.  You need at
  least the perl 5.80 base package installed.  If not, click on the
  "Mark" button.

  Next, search for mysql - it should be under "Databases".  Make sure
  that mysql and mysql-clients are installed.  If not, click on "Mark".

  Search for gcc.  You're going to need gcc and gcc-c++ installed.

  Search for freetype2.  Make sure that you've got freetype2 and
  freetype2-devel installed.

  Finally, check for qt.  You'll need libqt3-devel (under folder "KDE
  and Qt") and libqt3 ("Libraries").

  Make sure that cdialog is installed if you want to use mythtv with a
  remote control.

  alsa-utils is needed for setting the volume.

  If you marked anything to install, click on Install Marked.  Click
  "Yes" or OK if you get a message about satisfying dependencies.


  [1m2.2.2.  Command-line installation.[0m

  This section details the various methods for installing pre-requisites
  from the command line.


  [1m2.2.2.1.  Mandrake 8.2 and 9.0[0m

  The simplest tool for installing packages from the command line is
  [1murpmi[22m.

  Open a shell, and execute the following, all on the same line:


       % su -
       # urpmi perl-5.8 mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel libqt3-devel cdialog
       alsa-utils



  You may get asked a number of questions regarding dependencies.  It's
  best to answer "YES".

  However, you might get this when you execute the command above:



  [root@pvr root]# urpmi perl-5.8 mysql gcc gcc-c++
  freetype2-devel libqt3-devel cdialog
  everything already installed



  In that case, you're ready to move onto the next step.

  [1m2.2.2.2.  Red Hat Linux 8.0[0m

  [Please submit instructions]


  [1m2.2.2.3.  Gentoo.[0m

  [Please submit instructions]


  [1m3.  Setting up paths and ldconfig.[0m

  There are some paths that need to be modified before starting the main
  compile of mythtv, otherwise you will get errors.


  [1m3.1.  Distribution-specific information.[0m

  [1m3.1.1.  Mandrake 9.0[0m

  As root, create the following file in /etc/profile.d  On my system I
  call it "mythtv.sh".

  Open a shell, and switch to superuser mode.  [1mNOTE: ^D [22mmeans press [1mCTRL[0m
  and [1md [22mat the same time.



       % su -
       # cd /etc/profile.d
       cat > mythtv.sh
       export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3
       export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/qt3/bin
       ^D

       # chmod a+x mythtv.sh
       # exit
       % exit



  The last two commands are to exit out of the shell.  This way, when
  you next open a shell your new commands will take effect.


  [1m3.1.2.  Red Hat Linux 8.0[0m

  [Please submit instructions]


  [1m3.1.3.  Gentoo.[0m

  [Please submit instructions]



  [1m3.2.  Checking that it worked.[0m

  Open a shell and switch to superuser mode again.


       % su -
       # set

       [lots of text]
       QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3
       PATH=/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games:/usr/lib/qt3/bin:/home/mythtv/bin:/usr/lib/qt3/bin



  You should see QTDIR and the path changes you made.

  Next, we need to make sure that the libraries that we're building will
  be found when we need them.


  [1m3.3.  Modifying /etc/ld.so.conf[0m

  Switch to /etc and execute the following:


       # cd /etc
       # cat >> ld.so.conf
       /usr/local/lib
       ^D

       # ldconfig
       # exit
       %



  [1m4.  Downloading and compiling.[0m

  Get mythtv from the mythtv.org <http://www.mythtv.org> web site.  Save
  the tarball to a directory you can find.

  Get XMLTV from http://xmltv.sourceforge.net
  <http://xmltv.sourceforge.net>.  Download version 0.5.2

  Get lame from http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3 <http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3>.
  Download the source code to v3.92 by following the links to
  sourceforge.net


  [1m4.1.  Notes on compiling on a system with non-Intel processors.[0m

  If you've got a system with an AMD K6-2 or a VIA C3 processor, make
  the following change in the settings.pro file.

  Look for

  -march=pentiumpro


  and replace it with

  -march=i586

  before you compile.

  Recent AMD processors, like the Duron, Thunderbird and Athalon don't
  need this change.


  [1m4.2.  Building LAME.[0m

  Open a shell and switch to the directory where you saved lame.


       % tar -xzf lame-3.92.tar.gz
       % cd lame-3.92
       % ./configure
       % make
       % su
       # make install



  Check that it worked:


       # ls -l /usr/local/lib
       -rw-r--r--    1 root     root       381706 Nov  4 14:22 libmp3lame.a

       libmp3lame.so.0.0.0*

       # exit
       %



  [1m4.3.  Building XMLTV.[0m

  Untar the xmltv file:


       % tar -xjf xmltv-0.5.2.tar.bz2
       % cd xmltv-0.5.2



  Install the xmltv prerequisites:


       % su -
       # perl -MCPAN -e shell
       cpan> install XML::Twig
       cpan> install Date::Manip
       Date::Manip is up to date.
       cpan> install LWP
       cpan> install XML::Writer
       cpan> exit



  Change to the XMLTV directory and compile it:


       % cd xmltv-0.5.2
       % perl Makefile.PL



  You can answer "N" to the tv_check, tv_pick_cgi questions.  Say "yes"
  to the grabber required for your location.

  You may get errors about modules not being installed.  They shouldn't
  matter if you're installing North America and have followed the
  instructions to this point.


       % make
       % make test
       % su
       # make install
       # exit

       % mysql < mc.sql



  [1m6.  Setting up alsa and the mixer.[0m

  If your video doesn't appear to be in-sync with your audio, it could
  be because you are listening to the real-time audio from your video
  card rather than after it's been processed and synchronized to the
  video by mythtv.

  What you need to do is to mute the "line-in" of your sound card and
  also set it as the recording source.

  There are two ways to do this.  Graphically, and from the command
  line.


  [1m6.1.  Graphically setting up the mixer.[0m

  Open Kmix by K->Multimedia->Sound->Kmix

  Click on Settings->Configure  Make sure that "Tick Marks" and "Show
  labels" have "X"'s in them.  This will make it easier to find the
  correct audio source.  Click OK.

  On the mixer page, look for Line-In on your sound card.  You should
  see two LED's - a green one at the top, and a red one at the bottom.
  The green one at the top is for muting; you want to make sure that the
  green LED is a dark green, meaning that it's "off".  You also want to
  click on the red LED so that it turns bright red, indicating that it's
  "ON"; this insures that the Line-in is used as the source.  Click OK,
  and make sure that you save the settings so that this is your default.



  [1m6.2.  Setting the mixer from the command line.[0m

  If you're running Mandrake 9.0 and have installed the alsa-utils
  package, then the [1mamixer [22mprogram can be used to setup the mixer.



       % amixer set Master,0 100%,100% unmute
       % amixer set Line,0 100%,100% mute capture
       % su -
       # alsactl store
       # exit
       %



  That takes care of setting the volume correctly, and the alsa startup
  script will restore the volume after a reboot.


  [1m7.  Setting up a remote control.[0m

  mythtv does not have native remote control receiver and decoder
  software built-in.  Instead, remote control functions are implemented
  by cooperating with lirc, the Linux Infra Red Control program.  lirc
  handles the IR hardware and passes keystrokes to mythtv, which then
  acts as if the user had pressed the keys on the keyboard.

  lircd has two prerequisites:  dialog, available in Mandrake through
  the "cdialog" RPM, and the kernel source.  Mandrake 9.0 is using the
  2.4.19 kernel, so the easiest thing is to go to http://www.kernel.org
  <http://www.kernel.org> and download the full 2.4.19 tar file from
  http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/
  <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/>.


  [1m7.1.  Obtaining the kernel.[0m

  An easy way is to use the wget command:


       % wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.19.tar.bz2



  Next, open a shell and login as superuser.


       % su -
       # cd /home/[yourusername]
       # mkdir /usr/src
       # mv linux-2.4.19.tar.bz2 /usr/src
       # cd /usr/src
       # tar -xjf linux-2.4.19.tar.bz2
       # chown -R root.root linux-2.4.19
       # ln -sf linux-2.4.19 linux
       # exit



  [1m7.2.  Obtaining and compiling lirc.[0m

  You're going to need to download and compile lircd.  Go to
  http://www.lirc.org <http://www.lirc.org> and download lirc; as of
  2002-11-07, the version available is 0.6.6.  Grab the remotes.tgz file
  as well.


       % tar -xjf lirc-0.6.6.tar.bz2
       % cd lirc-0.6.6
       % ./setup.sh



  You're going to need to know what sort of receiver you have and where
  it's connected.  In my case, I have a Pinnacle Studio TV card, with
  the IR receiver connected to COM1 (/dev/ttys0), so once the configura-
  tion menu came up I did Driver Configuration->Other Serial Port
  Devices->Pinnacle Systems Receiver->OK and on the next page selected
  COM1->OK.

  Each remote is different; some remote receivers connect directly to
  your capture card and not to a serial port, so make sure that you've
  got the correct one.


  You then click "Save Configuration and run configure" to continue.

  Once the configuration step is complete:


       % make
       % su
       # make install
       # chmod 666 /dev/lircd



  Next, we're going to manually start lircd the first time:


       # /usr/local/sbin/lircd



  Now, we're going to add the commands necessary for lircd to run each
  time we boot:


       # cd /etc/rc.d
       # cat >> rc.local
       echo "Starting lircd"
       /usr/local/sbin/lircd
       ^D
       # exit
       %



  This takes care of the lircd portion, which "listens" for the IR sig-
  nals. If everything went well, the install script for lircd put an
  appropriate config file for your remote into /etc/lircd.conf This file
  maps the buttons on the remote control to the IR pulses coming from
  the receiver.

  The next step is to convert those signals into something that can be
  used to control mythtv.


       % cd ~/mythtv-0.7/configfiles
       % cp lircrc.example ~/.lircrc



  or


       % cp lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv ~/.lircrc



  if you've got a Pinnacle Studio PCTV remote.


       % irw



  Start pressing the keys on your remote; [1mirw [22mwill print the name of the
  button as it is defined in your /etc/lircd.conf. If you don't see any-
  thing at this point, you need to troubleshoot further by going back to
  the lirc home page and investigating from there.

  If it is working, then press [1mCTRL-C [22mto abort the program.  Once you
  know that your remote is working, you need to run the [1mirxevent[0m
  program, which takes the key presses and sends them to mythtv.
  [1mirxevent [22misn't a daemon, so if you know that your remote is working
  you need to invoke it like this:


       % irxevent &



  If [1mirxevent [22misn't running, then mythtv will not respond to your remote
  control.

  Currently, mythtv doesn't have native support for controlling the
  mixer volume and mute settings.  A workaround at this time is to
  invoke the [1mamixer [22mprogram.  If you wish to define keys to control the
  mixer, the [1mirexec [22mprogram can accomplish this fairly easily.  The
  configfiles/lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv file has an example of
  calling an external program from a remote control button.


  [1m7.3.  Additional information for lirc.[0m

  Take a look at the lircrc.example files in the configfiles/ directory.
  In my case, (Pinnacle Studio card) the channel up and down functions
  weren't working, due to the fact that the button names were different
  than the default lircrc.example file that came with mythtv.

  The lircrc.example file has this:


  begin
      prog = irxevent
      button = ChannelUp
      config = Key Up CurrentWindow
  end

  begin
      prog = irxevent
      button = ChannelDown
      config = Key Down CurrentWindow
  end



  but the /etc/lircd.conf that comes in the lircd package defines the
  buttons for the Pinnacle Studio PCTV as:


                 channel+                 0x0000000000000017
                 channel-                 0x000000000000001C



  rather than "ChannelUp" and "ChannelDown".  I added the following to
  my /home/[yourusername]/.lircrc file:


       begin
           prog = irxevent
           button = channel+
           config = Key Up CurrentWindow
       end

       begin
           prog = irxevent
           button = channel-
           config = Key Down CurrentWindow
       end



  which took care of basic functionality.  Because the PCTV Studio
  remote has additional buttons, look at the configfiles/lircrc.exam-
  ple.pinnaclestudiopctv for an example of how to define additional but-
  tons, and how to debug potential button name conflicts between the
  lircrc.example file and how [1myour [22mremote defines the button names.

  By examining the button names defined in /etc/lircd.conf and using the
  [1mirw [22mprogram to make sure that your remote is working, you can create
  the appropriate mappings in .lircrc to get excellent remote
  functionality with mythtv.


  [1m8.  Configuring mythtv.[0m

  By this point, all of the prerequisites have been installed, [1mmysql [22mis
  running and has had its initial database setup.  It's now time to
  configure mythtv.



  [1m8.1.  Editing the settings.txt file.[0m

  Open a shell and switch to the /usr/local/share/mythtv directory.  You
  [1mMUST [22medit the settings.txt file so that it's appropriate for your
  system.  At a minimum, ensure that the BufferName, RecordFilePrefix
  and PIPBuffername variables are set to directories that exist on your
  system.  By default, these point to /mnt/store.  For example, you may
  wish to create a /var/video subdirectory, so you would change
  /mnt/store to /var/video


       % su
       # mkdir /var/video
       # chmod a+rwx /var/video
       # exit



  The settings.txt file is fairly self-explanatory.

  [1mNOTE[22m: although the width and height can be changed to almost anything,
  if you start mythtv and don't see video, it is likely that the
  video4linux (v4l) subsystem did not like the height and width
  parameters specified.  It's best to leave the default as-is until
  you're sure that mythtv is operational.

  Users in North America can now exit and save the file.  Users in other
  parts of the world need to modify the first line and modify the
  XMLTVGrabber variable to the correct grabber for their region.
  [1mtv_grab_uk [22mfor the UK, etc.  Use the name from the xmltv directory.


  [1m8.1.1.  Adding support for an external tuner.[0m

  mythtv supports changing the channel on an external tuner.  If you
  have an external tuner, like a DirecTV or digital cable set top box,
  the following command should be added to your settings.txt file:


       str ExternalChannelCommand=/usr/local/bin/changechannel



  The [1mchangechannel [22mprogram is not supplied with mythtv, so this is
  going to be dependant on what sort of external tuner you have.

  Feel free to browse some of what sort of hardware is available at
  http://shop.store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/cablepacks.html
  <http://shop.store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/cablepacks.html>, or if
  you wish to assemble your own, rather than purchase, the following may
  be helpful: http://www.snapstream.com/products/irblaster/sonydss.htm

  pinouts for RCA DSS receivers.


  [1m8.2.  Running setup.[0m

  Now that you've edited your settings.txt file, it's time to run the
  setup program and perform the initial configuration.

  Open a shell, and switch to the setup directory:



  % cd setup
  % ./setup
  % cd



  The setup program will ask you a few questions and then proceed to run
  the XMLTV grabber program.


  [1m8.3.  Running mythfilldatabase.[0m

  Now that the setup program has completed, run [1mmythfilldatabase [22mto get
  one week of data inserted into the database.

  [1mNOTE[22m:  [1mmythfilldatabase [22mmight take a while to complete, depending on
  any number of factors, most of which you can't control.  It's best to
  just let the program run to completion.

  [1mmythfilldatabase --manual [22mis another option; the manual option will
  allow you to fine tune channel frequencies  and specify which channels
  will be added to the database.



  [1m8.3.1.  Setting mythfilldatabase  to run from cron[0m

  In order to keep your database filled, [1mmythfilldatabase [22mshould be run
  once a day.

  The default [1mmythcrontab [22mfile will run the [1mmythfilldatabase [22mprogram
  every day at 0430.  If you want to change this, then open the
  configfiles/mythcrontab file in your favorite editor and modify it as
  you like.  Once you're satisfied with the time that [1mmythfilldatabase[0m
  will run, save and exit, and return to the shell prompt.



       % cd configfiles
       % crontab mythcrontab
       % crontab -l  NOTE: this is a lowercase L.
       # DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - edit the master and reinstall.
       # (mythcrontab installed on Mon Nov 11 20:36:28 2002)
       # (Cron version -- $Id$)
       # The following will run the mythfilldatabase shell script at 18:00 every
       day.  Format is
       # minutes hour day_of_month month day_of_week
       # In the case of mythfilldatabase, we want it to run at 0430 daily.
       # man 5 crontab for more information
       # Need to use a shell script because the QTDIR environment variable isn't
       # being honored by crontab?
       # The next part is all on one line.
       30 04 * * * /bin/bash $HOME/mythtv/MC/configfiles/mythfilldatabasecron
       %



  As you can see, [1mmythfilldatabase [22mwill now be run at 0430 every day.

  If you decide to alter the time that the [1mmythfilldatabase [22mruns, you
  can use the crontab command to open your existing job and edit it in
  place.


       % crontab -e



  The [1mcrontab -e [22mcommand will allow you to edit the existing crontab.
  [1mNOTE[22m:  By default, the crontab will use [1mvi [22mas your editor.  If you
  don't like to use [1mvi[22m, make sure that you've set VISUAL to something
  other than [1mvi[22m.



       % export VISUAL=/usr/bin/joe
       % crontab -e



  This will cause [1mcrontab [22mto use [1mjoe[22m, a visual editor that uses the
  Wordstar command sequence.  You may use [1memacs[22m, or any other editor
  that you're comfortable with.  You may also add the EXPORT command to
  your .bashrc or to the /etc/profile.d/mythtv.sh file.

  Once you've completed this step, run the [1mmythepg [22mprogram to check that
  the database has been filled.  The cursor keys will move you around
  the grid, the "I" key will give you more information on a program and
  ESC will exit out back to the shell.


  [1m9.  Using mythtv.[0m

  [1mmythfrontend [22mis the main interface to the mythtv program.  This
  program allows you to choose which of the other modules you'd like to
  run and ensures that programs that you've scheduled for recording
  actually get recorded, so it's important that this program is always
  running.



  [1m9.1.  Using themes with mythtv.[0m

  mythtv is "themeable", meaning that the visual appearance of the
  program can be modified by the user without re-compiling or altering
  the program functionality.  usr/local/share/mythtv/theme.txt allows
  you to alter the theme for mythtv.  The default theme is called
  "blue".  Other themes that ship with mythtv can be found in the
  /usr/local/share/mythtv/themes directory.  Change the first variable
  in the theme.txt file and exit and restart [1mmythfrontend [22mfor it to take
  effect.

  [1mNOTE[22m: Exiting [1mmythfrontend [22mwill stop any recordings you have in
  progress, so make sure that the system isn't busy if you modify the
  theme while [1mmythfrontend [22mis still running.
