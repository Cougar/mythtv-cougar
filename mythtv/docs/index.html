<EM>Initially, installation of mythtv seems like a huge task.  There are lots
of dependencies, and various distributions seem to do the same thing
different ways.  This document will attempt to give general installation
instructions, as well as including distribution-specific instructions where
necessary.</EM>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Hardware. </A>
</H2>

<P>mythtv is a software video encoder, which means that it uses a fairly
generic "dumb" video capture card to get frames of video, encodes them using
the CPU on your motherboard and writes them to disk.  High-end video capture
cards and devices like the Tivo and RePlay have dedicated encoder chips
which use specialized hardware to convert the video stream to the MPEG-2
format without using the motherboard CPU.  The main CPU has the
responsibility of running the Operating System and reading and writing the
encoded frames to the disk.  These tasks have fairly low CPU requirements
compared to encoding video, which is why a device like a Series 1 Tivo can
run with only 16MB of RAM and a 54Mhz CPU.</P>
<P>Currently, there are no known MPEG-2 encoder cards that have video4linux
drivers which would be suitable for use with mythtv.  Once the drivers are
written, support for hardware MPEG-2 encoders can be integrated.</P>
<P>There are many variables that go into the question: "How fast a CPU do I
need to run mythtv"?  Obviously, the faster your CPU, the better your
experience will be with mythtv.  Performing the "Watch TV" function, where
the CPU is both encoding and decoding video simultaneously to allow Pause,
Fast Forward and Rewind functions for live TV requires more CPU then just
encoding or decoding.  mythtv also supports multiple encoder cards in a
single PC, increasing the CPU requirements if you are going to
simultaneously encode multiple programs.</P>
<P>Here are a few data points:
<UL>
<LI>A PIII/733Mhz system can encode one video stream using the RTJPEG
codec using 512x480 capture resolution.  This does not allow for live TV
watching, but does allow for encoding video and then watching it later.</LI>
<LI>The developer states that his AMD1800+ system can <B>almost</B>
encode two MPEG4 video streams and watch one program simultaneously.</LI>
<LI>A PIII/800Mhz system with 512MB RAM can encode one video
stream using the RTJPEG codec with 480x480 capture resolution and play it back
simultaneously, thereby allowing live TV watching.</LI>
<LI>A dual Celeron/450Mhz is able to view a 480x480 MPEG4/3300Kbps file
created on a different system with 30% CPU usage.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  You <EM>must</EM> use DMA for hard drive access to prevent
choppy or jittery video.  Red Hat Linux 8.0 apparently does not enable DMA
at boot time.  See the Troubleshooting Section for 
<A HREF="#Setting_DMA">instructions</A> on how to do this.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Software.</A>
</H2>

<P>There are a few ways of installing programs on Linux systems; you can either
use the graphical tools that come with your distribution, or you can use
command-line utilities.  Either system will get the job done, and it all
depends on your comfort level with Linux.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: If you are using mythtv on multiple systems, at least one of
them will maintain the master database and will need mysql installed.  </P>
<P>In order to compile mythtv, we need to make sure that the software it needs
is installed.  As of 2002-12-17, this list includes <B>perl</B>,
<B>mysql</B>, <B>gcc</B>, <B>freetype2-devel</B>,
<B>XFree86-devel</B> and <B>qt-devel</B>.  If you're going to use a
remote control with mythtv, you're going to need the <B>cdialog</B>
package in order to compile <B>lircd</B>.</P>
<P>There appears to be issues with ALSA and simultaneously recording and playing 
sound, which is a core requirement for mythtv.  If you are not running 
ALSA 0.9.0rc6 and experience lock-ups of your system when trying to use mythtv, 
then please check the main ALSA website and upgrade to the latest version,
or see if your distribution has already packaged the latest ALSA drivers.</P>

<H3><A NAME="graphicinstalltools_"></A> Graphical installation tools. </H3>

<H3>Mandrake 9.0</H3>

<P>On systems running KDE, a tool which will allow you to see what packages
are available and if they're installed on your system can be accessed by
clicking K->Configuration->Packaging->KPackage</P>
<P>There are many inter-related modules, so make sure that you've got the
main package for each one, and not a sub package for an unrelated item.  For
example, there are many modules that have "perl" in them; some are a part of
the apache web server, others are a part of the perl distribution.  In each
case, we're looking to make sure that the primary module is getting
installed.</P>
<P>Click the magnifying glass or press <B>CTRL-F</B> and enter "perl" as your
search term.  You should find it under the "Perl" folder.  You need at least
the perl 5.80 base package installed.  If not, click on the "Mark" button.</P>
<P>If you are going to be installing mysql on this system, search for mysql -
it should be under "Databases".  Make sure that mysql and mysql-clients are
installed.  If not, click on "Mark".</P>
<P>Search for gcc.  You're going to need gcc and gcc-c++ installed.</P>
<P>Search for freetype2.  Make sure that you've got freetype2 and
freetype2-devel installed.</P>
<P>Search for XFree86-devel.</P>
<P>Finally, check for qt.  You'll need libqt3-devel (under folder "KDE and
Qt") and libqt3 ("Libraries").</P>
<P>Make sure that cdialog is installed if you want to use mythtv with a remote
control.</P>
<P>alsa-utils is needed for setting the volume.</P>
<P>If you marked anything to install, click on Install Marked.  Click "Yes" or
OK if you get a message about satisfying dependencies.</P>

<H3>Red Hat Linux 8.0 </H3>

<P>Red Hat Linux 8.0 does not have the same graphical package manager used
by other distributions, so you will need to use Red Hat's package
manager.  This is the same utility you saw upon installation from the Red
Hat Linux 8.0 installation CD, and it allows you to select packages at
installation time, or once the system is up and running.  You can access
this program by selecting 
<PRE>
RedHatMenu>System Settings>Packages
</PRE>
</P>
<P>If you did a typical Desktop install of Red Hat Linux 8.0 make sure you have
selected:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>KDE Desktop Environment</LI>
<LI>SQL Database Server -  you will have to click on "details" and make 
sure "mysql-server" is checked.  (only required on the master system)</LI>
<LI>Development Tools</LI>
<LI>X Software Development</LI>
<LI>KDE Software Development</LI>
<LI>Kernel Development</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Click Install to continue.</P>
<P>You can not install qt-MySQL, a necessary prerequisite, graphically. To  
install this package using the command line do</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ up2date --solvedeps qt-MySQL

</P>

<H3><A NAME="CLIinstalltools_"></A> Command-line installation. </H3>

<P> This section details the various methods for installing pre-requisites
from the command line.</P>

<H3>Mandrake</H3>

<P><B>urpmi</B> is the simplest tool for installation of packages from the
command line.  The difficult part is the configuration aspect.  The
following website 
<A HREF="http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php">http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php</A> will allow you to choose
a mirror site and then present the command-line configuration text for that
mirror.  You will most likely need to add a "Contrib" mirror to your setup.</P>

<H3>Special instructions for Mandrake 8.2</H3>

<P>Mandrake 8.2 does not have a pre-packaged libqt3-devel, so you must compile and
install this manually.  The following command will install the
pre-requisites for qt3, so don't skip this step.  
The simplest tool for installing packages from the command line is
<B>urpmi</B>.</P>
<P>Open a shell, and execute the following.  You may get asked a number of
questions regarding dependencies.  It's best to answer "YES".</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ urpmi mesa-common-devel libmng1-devel mysql-devel libunixodbc2-devel
$ urpmi postgresql-devel xfree86-static-libs
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Once all of the pre-requisites have been installed, the next step is to
obtain and compile the source RPM.</P>
<P>Go to 
<A HREF="http://www.rpmfind.net">http://www.rpmfind.net</A> and search for
<CODE>qt3</CODE>.  There will be a number of different versions available.  As
of 2002-12-02, the latest version for Mandrake is called
<CODE>qt3-3.0.5-7mdk.src.rpm</CODE>. Unless you are running <B>Mandrake
Cooker</B> (the beta version of the next release of Mandrake), make sure to
download the standard "Mandrake" release.  Download the <CODE>.src.rpm</CODE>
file to a directory that you can find.  
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# cp qt3-3.0.5-7mdk.src.rpm /usr/src/RPMS/SRPMS
# cd /usr/src/RPMS/SRPMS
# rpm --rebuild qt3-3.0.5-7mdk.src.rpm
# cd ../RPMS
# ls -l
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The "ls -l" command will show you a directory listing.  There should be two
files, one will be named "qt3" and the other will be "qt3-devel".  The full
filenames will vary, so one you know the filename, you can install them with
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# rpm -Uvh [filename1]
# rpm -Uvh [filename2]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Once this has completed (it can take a while, so please be patient),
continue by following the Mandrake 9.0 instructions.</P>

<H3>Mandrake 8.2 and 9.0</H3>

<P>The simplest tool for installing packages from the command line is
<B>urpmi</B>.</P>
<P>Open a shell, and execute the following, all on the same line. You may get
asked a number of questions regarding dependencies.  It's best to answer
"YES".</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# urpmi perl mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel cdialog alsa-utils
# urpmi XFree86-devel
</PRE>

</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: Mandrake 8.2 users, <EM>do not</EM> execute the following
command.  You've already manually installed the files in the previous
section.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# urpmi libqt3-devel

</P>
<P>However, you might get this when you execute the command above:

<H3>Gentoo. </H3>

<P>If KDE has not been installed on your system: Edit
<CODE>/etc/make.conf</CODE> and locate the "USE" variable. If the line is
commented out, remove the comment. The line should have at least:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

Next you need to build KDE. If you don't plan on using the ebuilds as 
described in the Gentoo section then you also need to install lame.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If KDE has already been installed, by default, QT libraries with SQL support 
are not built. To enable SQL support, add "mysql qt" to your USE variable in 
<CODE>/etc/make.conf</CODE> and rebuild QT by running
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>Red Hat Linux 8.0 uses an unusual character encoding scheme which causes
problems when running certain programs. As a result, whenever you run setup

Failure to set this variable will result in a lot of UTF-8 errors.</P>
<P>There are two modifications that you can make to your system to avoid 
this problem. The first is a system wide solution, the second will only

<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Setting up ALSA and the mixer.</A></H2>

<P>If your video doesn't appear to be in-sync with your audio, it could be
because you are listening to the real-time audio from your video card rather
than after it's been processed and synchronized to the video by mythtv.</P>
<P>What you need to do is to mute the "line-in" of your sound card and also
set it as the recording source.</P>
<P>There are two ways to do this.  Graphically, and from the command line.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Graphically setting up the mixer.</A>
</H2>

<H3>Mandrake 9.0</H3>

<P>Open Kmix by K->Multimedia->Sound->Kmix</P>
<P>Click on Settings->Configure  Make sure that "Tick Marks" and "Show
labels" have "X"'s in them.  This will make it easier to find the correct
audio source.  Click OK.</P>
<P>On the mixer page, look for Line-In on your sound card.  You should see
two LED's - a green one at the top, and a red one at the bottom.  The green
one at the top is for muting; you want to make sure that the green LED is a
dark green, meaning that it's "off".  You also want to click on the red LED
so that it turns bright red, indicating that it's "ON"; this insures that
the Line-in is used as the source.  Click OK, and make sure that you save
the settings so that this is your default.</P>

<H3>Red Hat Linux 8.0</H3>

<H3>Using OSS drivers.</H3>

<P>Red Hat Linux 8.0 ships with OSS sound drivers rather than the ALSA
drivers recommended by the mythtv team. The OSS drivers do work for some
people, and for some cards, but others report problems (sync and jitter)
with OSS. In addition, OSS does not support full duplex on some cards, which
is required if you want to record and play sound using just one sound card.
ALSA has good full duplex support, and also has drivers for some built-in
(motherboard) sound cards that OSS does not. Installing ALSA is less painful
than you might think, so we encourgage you to go that route. For those of
you who do not wish to install ALSA you must do this:</P>
<P>To configure sound to work with mythtv, select 
<PRE>
RedHat Menu>Sound &amp; Video>Volume Control
</PRE>

to open up a mixer. Make sure your global volume (on the far left)
is up. Also make sure that the "line in" section has "mute" and "record"
checked and that the gain is turned up. You may have to experiment with
volume/gain levels to get the best sound.  If you experience difficulty with
sound try moving your patch cord from "Line in" to "Mic in". You will need
to go back to the mixer and select "mute" and "record" on the "Mic in" and
turn up the gain for the Mic rather than Line.</P>

<H3>Using ALSA drivers.</H3>

<P>For those of you who do want to install ALSA please follow the 
directions below, compiled with much assistance from Gregorio Gervasio.</P>
<P>First you must find out the name of your driver, which isn't necessarily the
same as the name of your sound card. Go to 
<A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/">http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/</A>, find your sound card on the
list and click "details". Near the top it will say something like "The
module options for snd-XXX", where XXX is the name of your driver. In the
instructions below, replace "XXX" with the name of your driver.</P>
<P>Download the development release (0.9.x) from the ALSA web site 
<A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org">http://www.alsa-project.org</A>.  You
need at least three files:
<UL>
<LI>alsa-driver-0.9.x.tar.bz2</LI>
<LI>alsa-lib-0.9.x.tar.bz2</LI>
<LI>alsa-utils-0.9.x.tar.bz2</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Start with the alsa-driver package:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ tar -xjf alsa-driver-0.9.x.tar.bz2
$ cd alsa-driver-0.9.x
$ ./configure --with-cards=XXX --with-sequencer=yes
$ make
$ su
# make install
# ./snddevices
# exit
$
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This will compile and install the kernel modules and initialization
scripts, as well as create device nodes in /dev.</P>
<P>Install the rest of the packages:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cd ~
$ tar -xjf alsa-lib-0.9.x.tar.bz2
$ cd alsa-lib-0.9.x
$ ./configure
$ make

# exit
$ cd ..
$ tar -xjf alsa-utils-0.9.x.tar.bz2
$ cd alsa-utils-0.9.x
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
# make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Next, you must edit <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> so that the ALSA modules are
loaded automatically. The first step is to remove your old OSS
configuration to ensure that you don't end up with mysterious conflicts in
the future.  You should end up with a <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE> file that has
this configuration:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>"XXX" should be the ALSA driver name for your sound card/chip. In some rare
cases you need to supply extra options to the driver. These options are
descried in the "INSTALL" file in the alsa-driver directory or at 
<A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/">http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/</A>.</P>
<P>For now we will assume that no extra options are required.  The next step is
to ensure that the ALSA drivers are started during boot-up.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# cd /etc/rc.d/init.d
# /sbin/chkconfig --add alsasound
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The next set of instructions will cause the ALSA volume/mixer/etc. state to
be saved when the machine is shut down properly. Note that the mixer
settings won't get restored the next time you boot unless you ran the
shutdown script or you've explicitly saved the state which you can do
as root with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# alsactl -f /etc/asound.state store
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Reboot your machine.  Login and adjust the sound levels using "alsamixer". 
You should increase the main volume (the first slider) and the PCM volume,
and unmute them by hitting "m".  For MythTV, if your tuner card audio output
is patched to the Line-In input of your sound card, set the Line input for
capture by pressing SPACE at the slider and mute it by pressing "M". If
you've patched your tuner card to the Mic-In port of your soundcard, follow
the same instructions but make sure that you're on the Mic slider.</P>
<P>Test the driver by playing a simple file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ aplay /usr/share/sounds/info.wav
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If it works, you're done installing ALSA!</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Setting the mixer from the command line.</A>
</H2>

<P>If you're running Mandrake 9.0 and have installed the alsa-utils package,
then the <B>amixer</B> program can be used to setup the mixer.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ amixer set Master,0 100%,100% unmute
$ amixer set Line,0 100%,100% mute capture
$ su
# alsactl store

$ 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

That takes care of setting the volume correctly, and the ALSA startup script
will restore the volume after a reboot.</P>
<P>You may also use the <B>alsamixer</B> program to set the volume.  First,
start <B>alsamixer</B> from the command line.  You should start out on the
"Master" volume control slider.  Use the up and down cursor to set the
master volume to around 75%.  Next, use the left and right cursor keys to
move around on the screen until you find the "Line" slider.  Press SPACE to
set it as the capture source, set the level to around 50-75% and press "M"
to mute it.  You can now press ESC to exit out of the <B>alsamixer</B>
program.</P>

<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Setting up a remote control.</A></H2>

<P>mythtv does not have native remote control receiver and decoder software
built-in.  Instead, remote control functions are implemented by cooperating
with <B>lirc</B>, the Linux Infra Red Control program.  <B>lirc</B>
handles the IR hardware and passes keystrokes to mythtv, which then acts as
if the user had pressed the keys on the keyboard.</P>
<P>Some IR devices require a kernel recompile, and some don't. However, all at
least require having the kernel source available as a resource for the lirc
build process. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Mandrake</A>
</H2>

<P>lircd has two prerequisites:  <B>dialog</B>, available in Mandrake through the
"cdialog" RPM, and the kernel source.  Mandrake 9.0 is using the 2.4.19
kernel, so the easiest thing is to go to 
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</A> and download
the full 2.4.19 tar file from 
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/</A>.</P>

<H3>Obtaining the kernel.</H3>

<P>An easy way is to use the wget command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>You're going to need to download and compile lircd.  Go to 
<A HREF="http://www.lirc.org">http://www.lirc.org</A> and download lirc; as
of 2002-11-07, the version available is 0.6.6.  Grab the remotes.tgz file as

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You're going to need to know what sort of receiver you have and where it's
connected.  In the case of the Pinnacle Studio TV card, with the IR receiver
connected to COM1 (/dev/ttys0), once the configuration menu comes up,
perform the configuration by going to Driver Configuration->Other Serial
Port Devices->Pinnacle Systems Receiver->OK and on the next page select
COM1->OK.</P>
<P>Each remote is different; some remote receivers connect directly to your
capture card and not to a serial port, so make sure that you've got the
correct one.</P>
<P>You then click "Save Configuration and run configure" to continue.</P>
<P>Make sure you read the last text generated by the configure step. It will
tell you if you require a kernel recompile, and what the name of your kernel
module will be (if necessary). For instance a home-built receiver may
require a kernel recompile, so you would be notified that you will have to
load the lirc_serial module. If you did not get any such messages skip the
kernel recompile steps below and go directly to making and installing the
lirc driver.</P>
<P>Once the configuration step is complete:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

# make install
# chmod 666 /dev/lircd

<H3>Recompiling your kernel on Red Hat Linux</H3>

<P>Don't Panic! Red Hat makes a kernel recompile very easy. They provide  
configuration files that make it so you can recompile your kernel with  
Red Hat defaults. And as a side benefit, your kernel will be compiled  
specifically for your architecture. For a more detailed description (or  
if you run into trouble) of how to do this go to  
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/custom-guide/  ch-custom-kernel.html">http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/custom-guide/  ch-custom-kernel.html</A></P>

</P>
<P>at this point you must look at the file names and determine which  
config file is right for you. For instance if you have an Athlon XP you  
should choose "kernel-2.4.18-athlon.config" but if you have a dual  
processor P4 you might choose "kernel-2.4.18-i686-smp.config"</P>

</P>
<P>At this point you will get a graphical configuration utility. All that  
you must do to make lirc work is go to the "character devices" section  
and change "Standard/generic (8250/16550 and compatible UARTs) serial  
support" from "y" to "m". Now if you want you can have a look around.  
For instance, you might wish to turn off ham radio support, or perhaps  
turn off pcmcia support if you are not on a laptop. But be careful!  
Only change things you know you can change. If you are not sure, just  
stick to the one required change. Click "save and exit".

Start pressing the keys on your remote; <B>irw</B> will
print the name of the button as it is defined in your

to troubleshoot further by going back to the lirc home page and investigating
from there.</P>
<P>If it is working, then press <B>CTRL-C</B> to abort the program.  Once you
know that your remote is working, you need to run the <B>irxevent</B>
program, which takes the key presses and sends them to mythtv. 
<B>irxevent</B>
isn't a daemon, so if you know that your remote is working you need to
invoke it like this: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ irxevent &amp;

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If <B>irxevent</B> isn't running, then mythtv will not respond to your remote

<P>Currently, mythtv doesn't have native support for controlling the mixer
volume and mute settings.  A workaround at this time is to invoke the
<B>amixer</B> program.  If you wish to define keys to control the mixer,
the <B>irexec</B> program can accomplish this fairly easily.  The

which took care of basic functionality.  Because the PCTV Studio remote
has additional buttons, look at the
<CODE>configfiles/lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv</CODE> for an example of how
to define additional buttons, and how to debug potential button name
conflicts between the <CODE>lircrc.example</CODE> file and how <B>your</B>

<P>By examining the button names defined in <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> and using

</H2>

<P>By Carlos Talbot, 
<A HREF="mailto:carlos@talbot.net">mailto:carlos@talbot.net</A></P>
<P>Lirc has support for various IR transmitters. A popular model is the Actisys
IR-200L 
<A HREF="http://store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/irblasbun.html">http://store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/irblasbun.html</A>. It was
originally designed for IRDA communication, but can be used to transmit A/V remote
control codes. By using the lirc SIR driver, this device can easily be
integrated with mythtv. I have tested this device with an AT&amp;T DCT2000
digital cable box but the instructions can be used to configure other IRDA
devices and A/V remotes.</P>
<P>Follow the steps in the previous section.  When you run setup.sh, select
option 1, driver configuration. From here select option 6, IrDA hardware.
Select your appropriate device and the corresponding serial port, then Save
configuration &amp; run configure from the main menu. Once configure is done
type:</P>

<P>Please note: unlike the Pinnacle receiver above you will be compiling lircd
in addition to a kernel module for the SIR transmitter. Depending on whether
you have your serial port driver configured as a kernel module you might see
the following message during make:</P>

extracted the file from remotes/motorola/DCT2000 (gi-motorola-dct2000)</P>
<P>To test the lirc_sir module you can run <B>irw</B> to verify the codes are being

you should see something similar to the following:</P>

<P>By this point, all of the prerequisites have been installed,
<B>mysql</B> is running and has had its initial database setup.  It's now
time to configure mythtv.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Editing the settings.txt file.</A>
</H2>

<P>Open a shell and switch to the <CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv</CODE> directory. 
You <B>MUST</B> edit the <CODE>settings.txt</CODE> file so that it's
appropriate for your system.  At a minimum, ensure that the BufferName, RecordFilePrefix
and PIPBuffername variables are set to directories that exist on your system. 
By default, these point to <CODE>/mnt/store</CODE>.  For example, you may wish to create
a <CODE>/var/video</CODE> subdirectory, so you would change <CODE>/mnt/store</CODE>
to <CODE>/var/video</CODE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>settings.txt</CODE> file is fairly self-explanatory. 
Currently, mythtv supports two different video encoders, MPEG4 and RTJPEG. 
Take note that RTJPEG has lower CPU demands, but makes large files, and MPEG4
has high CPU demands, but makes smaller files.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: although the width and height can be changed to almost
anything, if you start mythtv and don't see video or you get "segmentation
fault" errors, it is likely that the video4linux (v4l) subsystem did not
like the height and width parameters specified.  It's best to leave the
default as-is until you're sure that mythtv is operational.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="deinterlace_"></A> <B>NOTE</B>: the <CODE>int Deinterlace=1</CODE>
variable controls the deinterlacer.  Support for deinterlacing requires that
your processor has SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions, aka "MMX2").  Early Intel
Celeron (those that don't use the Coppermine 0.18um core and are usually
&lt;600Mhz), Pentium Pro and Pentium II CPUs do not have SSE, so make sure that
you've got this set to "0" if you have one of these.  If you don't, you will
get "Illegal Instruction" errors.</P>
<P>To determine if you've got SSE, you can:

<P><B>mythfilldatabse --file</B> is an option if there isn't an XMLTV grabber

<H3>Setting <B>mythfilldatabase</B> to run from <B>cron</B></H3>

<P>In order to keep your database filled, <B>mythfilldatabase</B> should be
run once a day.</P>
<P>There are two ways to accomplish this:  either as a user-based cron job, or
as a system based cron.  If you use a user-based cron, you can select the
time that the cron job will be run.  A system-based cron job will run at the
same time as any other system cron jobs.</P>
<P>If you are a Mandrake 9.0 user and wish to use a system cron job, you can
perform the following steps:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</P>
<P>We can see from the display that the cron.daily job will run at 0402 every
morning.</P>
<P>If you wish to specify a custom time, then the user-based cron job is the
better method.</P>
<P>The default <B>configfiles/mythcrontab</B> file will run the <B>mythfilldatabase</B> program every day at 0430.  If you want to change this,
then open the <CODE>configfiles/mythcrontab</CODE> file in your favorite editor and

a mirror site and then present the command-line configuration text for that
mirror.  You will most likely need to add a "Contrib" mirror to your setup. 
Once you have done that, you can proceed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss15.10">15.10 Mythtv makes my system crash. </A>

<P>mythtv <EM>can not</EM> crash your system - it is a user-level program. 
If your system is crashing when you run mythtv, then you have some
issue with the drivers for your capture card or other hardware, or the CPU
fan has fallen off/broken and your system is overheating when asked to
perform a CPU intensive task like encoding video.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss15.11">15.11 Troubleshooting audio</A>
</H2>

<P>By Bruce Markey, 
<A HREF="mailto:bjm@lvcm.com">mailto:bjm@lvcm.com</A></P>
<P>Audio appears to be one of the bigger issues that users run into on the
mailing list.  If the audio isn't configured correctly, then mythtv will
often appear to hang, when in fact it is trying to manipulate the audio
subsystem and failing.  You may or may not receive error messages indicating
that the source of the error is the audio subsystem.</P>
<P>You can not use <B>xawtv</B> to determine if your audio is working
correctly, since <B>xawtv</B> is simply using the the analog sound patched
through line-in to line-out. It doesn't need to digitize the sound unless
you are using the recording function.</P>
<P>A better test to verify that sound will work for MythTV (and recording with
<B>xawtv</B> for that matter) is to startup <B>xawtv</B>, mute the
line-in then run <CODE>aplay /dev/dsp</CODE>. Once this test succeeds, MythTV
should also work correctly because it writes to and read from /dev/dsp in
the same way that <B>aplay</B> does.</P>
<P>To record audio along with video the audio signal must be digitized by a DSP
so that the audio data can be stored in a file. On playback, the audio data
is written to /dev/dsp and converted back to an analog signal. This analog
signal should then be sent to your speakers. Here is what is needed in
alsamixer:</P>
<P>CAPTUR source - the analog source to be sent to the DSP. This should be set
to the input source from the tuner card to the sound card. In most cases
this is Line but this could also be Aux, CD, Mic, etc., depending on how you
connect the input cable. This source should be muted to prevent patching
through the analog sound. The volume of this source will not affect the
record level.</P>
<P>Capture mixer - this sets the level for the analog to digital recording.
While a volume of 100% is recommended for testing, distortion may occur.
Lowering this level to 75% to 85% may result in better audio quality.
"Capture" should be marked as the CAPTUR destination.</P>
<P>PCM mixer - this sets the level for the digital to analog playback. While a
volume of 100% is recommended for testing, distortion may occur. Lowering
this level to 75% to 85% may result in better audio quality.</P>
<P>Master mixer - sets the level for the analog signal sent to line-out or the
speakers.</P>
<P>You may also want to ensure that <CODE>/dev/dsp</CODE> hasn't already been
grabbed by another process, like <B>esd</B>.  If <CODE>/dev/dsp</CODE> isn't
available, then mythtv won't work.</P>

<P><B>NOTE</B>:It should be clear that using the development version of
mythtv may cause loss of data on your system.  There is no guarantee that the development
version of mythtv will work for you.</P>
<P><B>THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL WORK.  USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK.</B></P>
<P>Here are some of the features in version 0.8:
<UL>
<LI>A front-end and back-end system.  The back-end is responsible for
maintaining the database and capturing and encoding the video.  The
front-end is responsible for displaying the video.  This allows you to put a
lightweight, quiet, diskless and fanless machine in "the living room", with a large server-type
machine in "the basement".  The front-end and back-end communicate over TCP
on a specified port.</LI>
<LI>GUI-based configuration.  Much of the configuration of mythtv can now
be done using a GUI-based setup, avoiding the necessity to edit the
<CODE>settings.txt</CODE> file.</LI>
<LI>Themes.  mythtv now has more themes for the user to choose from.</LI>
<LI>Recording profiles.  You may now setup various encoder profiles from
the GUI, giving you the flexibility to record programs using various quality
levels.</LI>
<LI>Increased hardware encoder support.  mythtv can now use the MJPEG
encoder/decoder found on Matrox G200 series cards.  This greatly reduces the
CPU utilization.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Problem reports for version 0.8 posted to the mailing list
should have accompanying solutions.</P>
<P>Before you begin, shutdown all running instances of 0.7.  You should perform
a <CODE>make clean distclean</CODE> before starting the compile process.</P>
<P>Compile and install the system as you would mythtv 0.7 by following the
instructions found in this HOWTO.  If you are installing mythtv on a new
machine, install the database by running the <CODE>database/mc.sql</CODE>
script as detailed in earlier sections of this document.</P>
<P>However, if you are upgrading an existing 0.7 system, you <EM>must</EM> run the
<CODE>database/0-7-to-0-8.sql</CODE> script before running the setup program to
ensure that the database structure is up to date.</P>
<P>Next, you must edit the
<CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv/backend_settings.txt</CODE> file.  Specify the IP
address or hostname of the back-end server and port.  You may specify
<CODE>localhost</CODE> if the front-end and back-end programs will be running on
the same machine.  This file is read by the backend server during start-up.</P>
<P>Once you're done editing the file, start the setup program:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cd setup
$ ./setup
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This will open the setup wizard which will allow you to graphically
configure your system.</P>
<P>Once the setup wizard is done: to run the new version of mythtv, you must
first start the back-end server:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ mythbackend &amp;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>and then run the front-end client:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ mythfrontend

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You should see the connection established between the front-end and back-end
systems by examining the mythbackend window; it will display the client
connection attempts.</P>
