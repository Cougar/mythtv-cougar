<P>Matthew Zimmerman has created a patch for MPlayer / Mencoder 
<A HREF="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">http://www.mplayerhq.hu</A> that allows
you view the files created by MythTV.  MythTV doesn't use standard
Nupplevideo files, which is why you MPlayer complains if you try to view
them.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  If you're using a hardware MPEG-2 encoder like the
PVR-250/350 you don't need to convert - the files are actually standard
MPEG-2 with a <CODE>.nuv</CODE> extension.  Change it to <CODE>.mpg</CODE> and the
files should display properly in other media players.</P>

</H2>

<P>MythTV is not dependent on any particular window manager.  If you wish to
run a lightweight window manager, the <CODE>configfiles/</CODE> directory has an
example of a <CODE>.twmrc</CODE> and <CODE>.fvwmrc</CODE> file you may use.</P>


<H2><A NAME="capture_resolution_"></A> <A NAME="ss21.3">21.3</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc21.3">What capture resolution should I use?  How does video work?</A>
</H2>

<P>While MythTV allows you to set various GUI and capture resolutions, not
all combinations make sense.</P>
<P>First, analog video signals have a defined vertical resolution.  In NTSC,
the video standard specifies that there are 525 vertical scan lines.  Once
the "extra" lines are removed (they're used to synchronize the video signal,
and encode closed captioning data), you have 480 vertical lines.</P>
<P>In PAL, there are 625 "raw" lines of resolution, with a net of 576 vertical
lines.</P>
<P>Horizontally, the maximum you can expect from a Bt8X8 chip is 720.</P>
<P>With this in mind, there are certain commonly accepted values for
resolution.  While other values may be accepted, they will cause scan lines
to be repeated or dropped.</P>
<P>From "best" to "worst", in NTSC:
<UL>
<LI>720x480 (but more commonly, 704x480.  "DVD" resolution)</LI>
<LI>640x480 4:3</LI>
<LI>544x480 (TiVo high resolution)</LI>
<LI>480x480 (Video CD resolution)</LI>
<LI>352x480 (ReplayTV "Standard" quality)</LI>
<LI>320x480 </LI>
<LI>544x240</LI>
<LI>480x240 </LI>
<LI>352x240 </LI>
<LI>320x240</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>As you can see, the lower quality values are half of the better ones. 
720x240 is possible, but isn't a good tradeoff relative to the number of
vertical lines lost.  In a PAL country, the you would use values like
720x576 or x288.</P>
<P>The higher resolutions will be more CPU intensive if you're using software
encoding (PVR-250/350 will have minimal host CPU impact even if you're using
720x480). If the CPU is overtaxed, frames will be dropped causing uneven
motion. You will likely see the best results at resolutions which average at
least 10% CPU idle time.  You can use system tools such as <CODE>top</CODE> or
<CODE>sar</CODE> to check the CPU % idle while recording.  If the CPU average
usage is consistently exceeding 90%, frames will need to be dropped during
peak times when more than 100% of the available CPU would be needed to
process all of the frames.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss21.4">21.4</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc21.4">MythTV GUI and X Display Sizes.</A>
</H2>

<P>MythTV is designed to be run as dedicated full screen TV application
but can also be run as a desktop application on a computer
monitor. Here are a few consideration for configuring sizes to best
suit you needs.</P>
<P>There are three sizes that are important for matching the MythTV GUI and
full screen TV playback to fit the screen:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the X display size</LI>
<LI>the X Desktop (virtual) dimensions</LI>
<LI>the MythTV GUI dimensions</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The MythTV GUI uses its GUI dimensions regardless of the other two and is
anchored to the upper left corner of the X Desktop.</P>
<P>The MythTV full screen mode uses the X display size dimensions regardless of
the other two and is anchored to the upper left corner of the X display.</P>

<H3>X Dimensions</H3>

<P>For output to a Television, common resolutions are 640x480, 800x600, and
some rare devices support 1024x768. Generally, higher resolutions are
better. However, you may find that you prefer the picture quality at one of
the lower resolutions. Everything in MythTV is scalable and should 'fit'
regardless of the resolution you choose.</P>
<P>Edit your X configuration file, usually "XF86Config-4", so that the the
resolution you want to use is listed first in the lists under "Screen". If
this resolution is higher than the resolutions supported by your output
device, you will see a 'panning' effect where moving the mouse to the edge
will scroll around a desktop area which is larger than the display size. If
this happens, edit your X configuration file to match the display size then
restart X.</P>

<H3>MythTV Dimensions</H3>

<P>In 0.10 and later, from "mythfrontend" go to Setup->Appearance.
The default for the height and width is "0" - this will cause
MythTV to automatically size itself to full screen. To ensure that
your new dimension settings take effect, exit and restart MythTV.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: When the GUI is full screen, you may need to set your window
manager to 'Click to Focus' for windows to stack properly.</P>
<P>The fonts for the GUI and OSD will scale to whatever sizes you use. Most
font sizes can be changed in setup selections. Make sure to use fonts large
enough to be read on a TV screen from a distance.</P>
<P>The full screen TV size is based on the X display size. For Xinerama, you
can specify a screen in Setup->General. The picture will be stretched to fit
the entire screen regardless of the 
<A HREF="#capture_resolution_">capture resolutions</A> used.</P>

<H3>Overscan Dimensions</H3>

<P>Because picture edges can be ragged and screen edges aren't straight,
Television is designed to project an image larger than the physical screen.
This is called "overscan". Underscan is fitting the entire image inside the
screen. This is useful for computer monitors so that toolbars and scrollbars
at the edges can be seen.</P>
<P>For best results, match the X display area as close as possible to the edges
of the physical screen. This can only be adjusted by your tv-out device or
by the settings for the television set. Many sets have these adjustments in
a 'service mode'.</P>
<P>MythTV has settings for "Overscan" in Setup->Playback. These can not, and do
not, cause the image to display beyond the edge of the X display area. The
purpose of these settings are to cut off rough edges and to expand the image
so that objects will appear to be the same size as a normal overscanned TV
picture.</P>

<H3>MythTV on the Desktop</H3>

<P>When using MythTV on a high resolution desktop monitor, set the MythTV
GUI dimensions to something much smaller than your X display resolution but
still large enough to read the fonts. The GUI screens will always be in the
upper left hand corner. However, your window manager may be able to minimize
these (ALT-F4 in KDE for example).</P>
<P>The TV picture will start in full screen mode. Press "f" to put the picture
in a window that can be moved and resized. By default, the picture uses the
recording resolution for its dimensions. If you check the box "Fixed
Aspect Ratio" in Setup->Playback, the windowed picture will always be
resized to normal 4:3 shape.</P>

</H2>

<P>btaudio allows you to obtain the audio data from your tuner card directly
over the PCI bus without using a soundcard.  This is useful if you would
like to use multiple tuner cards in a system without adding a soundcard for
each one, or if your existing soundcard is not capable of full-duplex
operation.</P>
<P>In order to use btaudio, your tuner card will need certain hardware
installed on it, and that hardware must be wired correctly.  The chip that
will allow you to use the btaudio module is the MSP34xx.  However, having a
MSP34xx is no guarantee that you will be able to use the btaudio module.</P>

</H2>

<P>If <B>mythfilldatabase</B> grabbed a channel which you do not want to
include in your TV listings, you can remove the entries from the xmltv
config file and the mysql database.  This often happens with premium
channels; for example, HBO or Showtime may be available on your cable TV
system, but is scrambled because you're not a subscriber to that channel. 
Since you can never watch it, you want to get rid of it.</P>
<P>First, comment out the channel from the &nbsp;/.mythtv/&lt;sourcename&gt;.xmltv file by
inserting a "#" in front of the unwanted entry. This will prevent
<B>mythfilldatabase</B> from grabbing future listings.</P>
<P>Next, delete the unwanted item from the channel table so that it will not
appear in the EPG or when changing channels.  The channels will always have
"1000" added to them, so for example, assuming that HBO is channel 15:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>Old program data will be removed over the course of a week. However, you may
want to immediately delete any current program listings for the channel that

</H2>

<P>MythTV is flexible in the way that you define multiple backend tuner
configurations.  The only hard-and-fast rule is that the Master Backend
<EM>must</EM> have a capture device defined, but shouldn't imply that the
capture device in the MBE must be the first capture card defined in the
database.</P>
<P>One example of an advanced configuration is the round-robin scheme.  Rather
than defining all of the cards on the master, you could first go into setup
on the master to define globals such as the general configuration and the
channel lineup but not the host-specific configuration item like the capture
card.  In this example, we will use a 4 tuner configuration, where two
slaves have one card each and the master has two.
<OL>
<LI>Add the first capture card on one of the slaves.  Complete the
configuration, connecting the input source to the card.  This will get
cardid #1 in the database.  Exit setup.</LI>
<LI>Configure the first capture card on the master backend.  This will get
cardid #2 in the database.  Exit setup.</LI>
<LI>Configure the first capture card on the second slave.  This will be
cardid #3 in the database.  Exit setup.</LI>
<LI>Configure the second capture card on the master backend.  This will
get cardid #4 in the database.  Exit setup.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Using this scheme, the master backend will not use both capture cards until
one of the following happens:
<UL>
<LI>There are four recordings scheduled for the same time</LI>
<LI>Both slaves are not available</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The scheduler in MythTV checks whether an encoder is available; if a slave
backend isn't running, its encoder isn't available, so the scheduler will
look for the next available encoder.  This makes MythTV very flexible; slave
tuners can come and go, and as long as there are enough tuners for what
you'd like to record it doesn't matter which tuner in particular is going to
be used.</P>
<P>Using this round-robin scheme along with a shared storage directory like
NFS and enabling the Master Backend Override setting will allow you to view
content even if the slave backend that recorded a program is not available.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss21.13">21.13</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc21.13">What is this transcoder thing, and how do I use it?</A>
</H2>

<P>The transcoder re-encodes files from one MythTV format to another.  The
main purpose of the transcoder is to allow users with hardware
encoders (PVR-250) or systems that can only record in RTJpeg due to
performance reasons (multiple capture cards, slow system, etc) to create
MPEG44 streams to save space.</P>
<P>The transcoder can be used in two ways:
<UL>
<LI>Automatically re-encode every file once it has completed recording</LI>
<LI> After marking commercials, the transcoder can be run manually to
delete the commercials from the file (thus further saving space)</LI>
</UL>

The two methods are independent.  The first is an automatic process that can be
enabled/disabled through the setup program; the second is a manual method which
must be invoked on each recording individually.</P>
<P>The second method can be used on files that have already been transcoded (or
files which were are already in the correct format), so only the frames
immediately following a cut section will be re-encoded, resulting in a very
minimal loss of quality.</P>
<P>To enable automatic transcoding, do the following:
start the setup program
under the host-specific settings:
set the Transcoder Auto-run checkbox</P>
<P>For either manual or automatic transcoding:
start mythbackend
start mythfrontend
select setup, and the Transcoding recording profile.
now select either RTJPEG or MPEG-4 (selecting any of the hardware
encoders will result in the transcoder not working).
set the other parameters as you'd like.  For best performance, you
should match the audio to the 'Default' profile.  If you plan to
only use the manual transcoder, you can choose to set the video to
be the same as the default profile too (as long as it is MPEG-4 or
RTJpeg)</P>
<P>Everything should now be setup properly.  If you elected to use the
Auto-Run feature, the transcoder will automatically launch after each
recording is complete.  The transcoder thread runs at a low priority, so it
should not impact any critical tasks or other recordings.</P>
<P>If you want to manually transcode a program, simply press 'X' while
watching a recording (you should have already finished marking all
commercials).  If you change your mind, hitting 'X' again will stop the
transcoding.</P>
<P>Once the transcode is complete, mythbackend will replace the old file
with the new as soon as it is no longer in use.</P>
