<P>You must ensure that any firewalls (either hardware, or a software
firewall installed by your distribution) will not block access to the ports
that will be used by the MythTV clients and servers on the "inside" LAN. 
The ports for MySQL (TCP port 3306) and mythbackend (TCP ports 6543 and
6544) must be open.  It is <EM>strongly</EM> recommended that you do
<EM>not</EM> expose the MythTV and MySQL ports to the Internet or your
"Outside" LAN.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc3.1">Hardware</A>
</H2>

<P>Hardware selection is a complex topic, one this HOWTO will only discuss
briefly and in general terms. The following subsections offer some general 
guidance but stop short of offering specific recommendations.</P>
<P>For a good MythTV experience, you must understand that MythTV exercises your
hardware more than a typical desktop. Encoder cards generate DMA across the
PCI bus.  The CPU is busy encoding / decoding video. Hard drives are
constantly reading and writing data. Building a MythTV system on older /
"spare" hardware may be an exercise in frustration and can waste many hours
of valuable time.</P>
<P>For more detail about actual configurations that others have used, Mark
Cooper has setup a hardware database at 
<A HREF="http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/">http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/</A>. The
website will let you browse what other users have reported as their hardware
configuration, and how happy they are with the results.</P>
<P>If you have specific questions about the suitability of specific hardware
choices, you can consult the archives of the mythtv-users mailing list at
<A HREF="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/</A> or
post a question to the list.</P>
<H3>CPU Type and Speed</H3>

<P>Selection of CPU type and speed is one of the trickiest elements of
hardware selection, mainly because there are so many tradeoffs which can be
made.  For example, if you have plenty of CPU, you can use higher bitrates
or capture sizes, etc.</P>
<P>MythTV has two modes of operation.  First, it can function as a software video
encoder, which means that it uses a fairly generic "dumb" video capture card
to get frames of video, encodes them using the CPU on your motherboard and
writes them to disk.  High-end video capture cards and devices like the TiVo
and ReplayTV have dedicated encoder chips which use specialized hardware to
convert the video stream to the MPEG-2 format without using the motherboard
CPU.  The main CPU has the responsibility of running the Operating System
and reading and writing the encoded frames to the disk.  These tasks have
fairly low CPU requirements compared to encoding video, which is why a
device like a Series 1 TiVo can run with only 16MB of RAM and a 54MHz CPU.</P>
<P>There are many variables that go into the question: "How fast a CPU do I
need to run MythTV"?  Obviously, the faster your CPU, the better your
experience will be with MythTV.  If you are using the software MPEG-4
encoder and performing the "Watch TV" function, where the CPU is both
encoding and decoding video simultaneously to allow Pause, Fast Forward and
Rewind functions for live TV requires more CPU then just encoding or
decoding.  MythTV also supports multiple encoder cards in a single PC,
thereby increasing the CPU requirements if you plan on simultaneously
encoding multiple programs.  As a general guideline, plan on 1GHz per
encoder if you are doing software-based encoding, less if you are using a
hardware-based encoder.</P>
<P>Here are a few data points:
<UL>
<LI>A PIII/733MHz system can encode one video stream using the MPEG-4
codec using 480x480 capture resolution.  This does not allow for live TV
watching, but does allow for encoding video and then watching it later.</LI>
<LI>A developer states that his AMD1800+ system can <B>almost</B>
encode two MPEG-4 video streams and watch one program simultaneously.</LI>
<LI>A PIII/800MHz system with 512MB RAM can encode one video
stream using the RTjpeg codec with 480x480 capture resolution and play it back
simultaneously, thereby allowing live TV watching.</LI>
<LI>A dual Celeron/450MHz is able to view a 480x480 MPEG-4/3300kbps file
created on a different system with 30% CPU usage.</LI>
<LI>A P4 2.4GHz machine can encode two 3300Kbps 480x480 MPEG-4 files and
simultaneously serve content to a remote frontend.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The second mode of operation is where MythTV is paired with a hardware-based
video encoder, such as a Matrox G200 or a Hauppauge
WinTV-PVR-150/250/350/500.  In this mode, because the video encoding is
being done by a dedicated video processor, the host CPU requirements are
quite low.  See the 
<A HREF="#video_capture_device">Video Capture Device</A> section for details.</P>
<P>If you have a Via M10000 series or a Hauppauge PVR-350, MythTV can use the
hardware-based video decoder for playback, which further reduces CPU
requirements.</P>

<H3>Memory</H3>

<P>A MythTV host that is both a backend and a frontend and using software
encoding with a single capture card should run adequately in 256MB of RAM.
Additional RAM above 256MB will not necessarily increase performance, but
may be useful if you are running multiple encoders.</P>

<H3>Hard Disk(s)</H3>

<P>Encoded video takes up a lot of hard disk space. The exact amount depends
on the encoding scheme, the size of the raw images and the frames per
second, but typical values for MythTV range from 700 megabytes/hour for
MPEG-4, 2 GB/hour for MPEG-2 and RTjpeg and 7 GB/hour for ATSC HDTV.</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="stop.eps">
<IMG SRC="stop.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  You <EM>must</EM> use DMA for hard drive access to prevent
choppy or jittery video.  Not all distributions enable DMA at boot time. See the Troubleshooting Section for 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-21.html#Setting_DMA">instructions</A> on how to do this.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>
</P>
<P>Writing video to disk is sensitive to timing issues; RTjpeg requires less
CPU with the tradeoff being larger files and needing to write to the disk
faster.  MPEG-4 requires more CPU, but the files are smaller.  At the
default resolution, MPEG-2 creates the largest files of all with almost no
CPU impact.</P>
<P>See the Troubleshooting 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-21.html#Setting_DMA">section</A> for more
information.</P>

<H3>Filesystems</H3>

<P>MythTV creates large files, many in excess of 2GB.  You <EM>must</EM> use a
filesystem that will allow you to create large files.  Filesystems known to
have problems with large files are FAT and FAT32.</P>
<P>Because MythTV creates very large files, a filesystem that does well at
deleting large files is important.  Numerous benchmarks show that XFS and
JFS do very well at this task.  You are strongly encouraged to consider
either of these for your MythTV filesystem.</P>
<P>Because of the size of the MythTV files, it may be useful to plan for future
expansion right from the beginning.  If your case and power supply have the
capacity for additional hard drives, read through the 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-23.html#LVM">LVM</A> and 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-23.html#advancedpartitionformatting">Advanced Partition Formatting</A> sections for some pointers.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="video_capture_device"></A> </P>
<H3>Video Capture Device </H3>

<P>In order to capture video, MythTV will need one or more video capture
devices with Linux drivers.  There are a number of classes of hardware
available for capturing video.  </P>
<H3>Frame Grabbers.</H3>

<P>This class of card is the simplest and is usually the cheapest.  There is no
on-board encoding of the analog video; hardware known as a Digital-Analog
Converter (DAC) takes the video and presents it to the computer in an
essentially raw digital form.</P>
<P>For a list of video capture cards known to work with Linux, please see
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv</CODE> for a partial
listing; even if your specific card is not listed, it may be that the vendor
is actually using a standard reference design and placing their own name on
it.  See the video4linux mailing list (
<A HREF="https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list">https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list</A>) for
more information and for specific hardware questions.</P>
<P>The most common inexpensive cards available use the Bt848 or Bt878 video
capture chip; examples are the "Hauppauge WinTV Go" card and the "AverTV
Desktop PVR" card, both of which use the bttv kernel module.</P>

<H3>Hardware MPEG-2 encoders.</H3>

<P>While inexpensive video-capture cards simply capture raw frames, leaving
encoding to software, some higher-end cards incorporate hardware-based
encoding. Using either a G200 MJPEG encoder card, or a MPEG-2 encoder card
supported by the IvyTV project 
<A HREF="http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/">http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/</A> such as the Hauppauge
PVR-150/250/350/500, Avermedia M179, Hauppauge "Freestyle" or Yuan M600
cards will allow you to use dedicated hardware encoders rather than your
CPU. (The PVR-350 can simultaneously be used as an output device.) Using the
on-board MPEG-2 encoder greatly reduces the CPU requirements for
encoding.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Motherboards with the Via chipset are notoriously bad with
DMA and have caused numerous issues with ivtv, including hard locks.  See

<H3>DVB capture cards.</H3>

<P>DVB is a video standard primarily found in Europe.  MythTV supports DVB;
see the pages maintained by Martin Smith 
<A HREF="mailto:martin@ethics-gradient.net">martin@ethics-gradient.net</A>
at 
<A HREF="http://www.ethics-gradient.net/myth/mythdvb.html">http://www.ethics-gradient.net/myth/mythdvb.html</A> for more
information.  To see if your DVB card is supported, see the list of cards at
<A HREF="http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb/CARDS">http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb/CARDS</A> for more information.</P>
<P>In the United States, you may use a card such as the TwinHan to obtain
unencrypted Free-To-Air satellite channels.</P>

<H3>HDTV.</H3>

<P>Currently there are two HDTV card with Linux drivers which are known to
operate in the United States - the HD-2000/HD-3000 cards available from
<A HREF="http://www.pchdtv.com/">http://www.pchdtv.com/</A> or 
<A HREF="http://mythic.tv/">http://mythic.tv/</A> and the Air2PC-ATSC-PCI
available from 
<A HREF="http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=103">http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=103</A>
or 
<A HREF="http://mythic.tv/">http://mythic.tv/</A>. </P>
<P> The
Air2PC is supported using the linux-dvb drivers.</P>
<P>To playback HDTV content, plan on a powerful CPU.  "How powerful?" depends
on a number of factors, such as the capture resolution, whether the video is
progressive or interlaced, and whether your display card has hardware-assist
support for Linux. For 720p content (1280x720), a 2.4GHz P4 should be
sufficient.</P>
<P>For 1920x1080i->1920x1080p with the better deinterlacing methods
done in real time a 2.4GHz CPU is taxed, but should work if you use "Bob and
Weave" deinterlacing, or if you have an NVIDIA card with MPEG-2 hardware
acceleration.  If you enable the hardware acceleration, you may be able to
use a 1.8GHz processor.</P>

<H3>Firewire.</H3>

<P>You may use the Firewire output of the DCT6200 or the SA3250.</P>

<H3>DBoxII or other devices running Neutrino</H3>

<P>You may use the Ethernet port of an DBoxII or a similar device to capture 
MPEG2. Your set top box has to be running the Neutrino GUI. </P>

<H3>USB Capture Devices.</H3>

<P>The Plextor ConvertX PVR devices are supported through Linux drivers
available from 
<A HREF="http://www.plextor.com/english/support/LinuxSDK.htm">http://www.plextor.com/english/support/LinuxSDK.htm</A>. MythTV uses the
Plextor to capture hardware encoded MPEG-4, so the host CPU requirements are low.</P>

<P>There are no known consumer-level capture devices which will allow you to
capture component output from a set-top box.</P>
<H3>Sound card</H3>

<P>The system needs a sound card or an on-board equivalent on the motherboard
to play back and in most cases, to record sound. Any sound card that can be
operated by the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) kernel modules will
work with MythTV.  However, some cards and drivers will provide better
quality or compatibility than others.  In particular, many audio
devices included on motherboards can be problematic.</P>
<P>The usual practice for capturing the audio associated with the video
is to run a cable from an audio output on the video capture card to
the Line input on a sound card. However, some video capture cards
provide on-board audio capabilities that work with the kernel
<CODE>btaudio</CODE> module instead, thereby eliminating the need for a
cable.  This is useful if you will be using multiple capture cards in
a single chassis, since each capture card will not need its own sound
card.  Note that a separate sound card is still required for playback
when using <CODE>btaudio</CODE>, and that often the audio recorded in this
way will be mono only.  See the 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-22.html#btaudio">btaudio</A>
section for more information.</P>

<H3>Video Display Card</H3>

<P>MythTV will work with just about any video card.  However, it is highly
recommended that you use a card which supports XVideo (XV) extensions. If
your card does not support XV, color conversion and scaling will be
performed by your CPU rather than the video card.  This is very CPU
and memory intensive and will often result in dropped frames and a
corresponding degradation of quality.  Check the XFree86 documentation
for details if you are uncertain about your preferred card.  You may
also run <CODE>xvinfo</CODE>; look for your video card to be listed as one
of the adapters.</P>

<P>If you want to use MythTV with a standard television, you will need a
physical connection from your video card to your TV set, which can either be
a TV-out port on the card itself or an external adapter that converts the
VGA signal to an appropriate video signal. "Appropriate" depends on a number
of factors, such as video standard (NTSC vs. PAL) type of input connection
(Composite vs. SVideo), etc.</P>
<P>Note that with some video cards and X drivers, XVideo extensions are
only supported on the VGA output, and not on the TV output.</P>

<H3>Cards with TV out</H3>

<P>The next section deals with a number of cards that are known to have
TV-out ports.  The list is unlikely to be complete, so if you know of
others, please post a message to the mythtv-users mailing list so the
information can be included in future versions of the HOWTO. The list is
organized by manufacturer.</P>

<H3><A NAME="atrpms"></A> Red Hat Linux/Fedora Core</H3>

<P>Red Hat Linux and Fedora Core 3 packages for MythTV and all of its add-on
modules and some themes have been packaged by 
<A HREF="mailto:Axel.Thimm@ATrpms.net">mailto:Axel.Thimm@ATrpms.net</A> and
are available at 
<A HREF="http://ATrpms.net/topic/multimedia/">http://ATrpms.net/topic/multimedia/</A>. All of the prerequisites for
MythTV (such as XMLTV) are available as RPM packages. If you have problems
with the RPMs, please contact the ATrpms lists at 
<A HREF="http://lists.ATrpms.net/">http://lists.ATrpms.net/</A> or file a
bug against 
<A HREF="http://bugzilla.ATrpms.net/">http://bugzilla.ATrpms.net/</A>.</P>
<P>Given the large number of dependent RPMs you are advised to use tools like
apt or yum for automatic retrieval and installation of the required RPMs.
(
<A HREF="http://ATrpms.net/install.html">http://ATrpms.net/install.html</A>) In this case a
special meta-package called mythtv-suite will allow you to install all of
MythTV and its add-ons, plus all dependencies.</P>
<P>If you don't have <B>apt</B> or <B>yum</B> on your machine, download and
install the atrpms-kickstart package from 
<A HREF="http://ATrpms.net/name/atrpms-kickstart/">http://ATrpms.net/name/atrpms-kickstart/</A>.
Install the package with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# rpm -Uvh atrpms-kickstart*

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Then run:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# apt-get update

<H3>Debian</H3>

<P>Debian packages for MythTV and most of its add-on modules are maintained
by Matt Zimmerman 
<A HREF="mailto:mdz@debian.org">mailto:mdz@debian.org</A> and are available at 
<A HREF="http://dijkstra.csh.rit.edu/~mdz/debian/dists/unstable/mythtv/">http://dijkstra.csh.rit.edu/~mdz/debian/dists/unstable/mythtv/</A>. 
Installation instructions can be found on those pages as well. All of the
prerequisites for MythTV are available as Debian packages, most of them from
the official Debian archive.</P>
<P>If you have followed the instructions on the above page you should have added
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
deb-src http://dijkstra.csh.rit.edu/~mdz/debian unstable mythtv
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>to your <CODE>/etc/apt/sources.list</CODE> file.  Running <B>apt-get update</B> and then
executing <B>apt-get build-dep mythtv</B> should install all the
pre-requisites required to compile MythTV.</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="warning.eps">
<IMG SRC="warning.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  Due to the requirement for Qt 3.1+, there are no packages for
Debian woody/stable.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>
</P>

<P>The Debian packages are configured such that MythTV programs should be
run as the <CODE>mythtv</CODE> user, which is automatically created during
installation.  This user has access to write new recordings to disk in the
default directory, read and write the database, access the audio and video
devices, and everything else that MythTV needs to do.</P>

<P>See <CODE>/usr/share/doc/<I>packagename</I>/README.Debian</CODE> for more
information, including copies of the MythTV documentation.  The
<CODE>mythtv-doc</CODE> package contains a copy of this HOWTO in
<CODE>/usr/share/doc/mythtv-doc</CODE>.</P>

<H3>Manual installation</H3>

<P>You may use the graphical tools that come with your distribution, or you
can use command-line utilities.  Either system will get the job done, and it
all depends on your comfort level with Linux.</P>
<P>In order to compile MythTV, we need to make sure that the software it needs
is installed.  As of 2003-03-15, this list includes <B>mysql</B>,
<B>gcc</B>, <B>freetype2-devel</B>, <B>XFree86-devel</B>,
<B>qt-devel</B> and <B>lame</B>.  If you're going to use a remote
control with MythTV, you're going to need the <B>cdialog</B> package in
order to compile <B>lircd</B> if your distribution doesn't have a
pre-packaged <B>lirc</B>.  If you are using <B>XMLTV</B> as a grabber,
you will need <B>perl</B>.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
NOTE:  Qt v3.1 or higher is required.

NOTE:  If you are going to be using RPMs to install various
components, you should be aware that not all packages include the necessary
headers for compiling packages.  If you're having trouble compiling, ensure
that you've installed the -devel version of a prerequisite.
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="graphicinstalltools_"></A> Graphical installation tools </H3>

<H3>Mandrake</H3>

<P>On systems running KDE, a tool which will allow you to see what packages
are available and if they're installed on your system can be accessed by
clicking K->Configuration->Packaging->KPackage</P>
<P>While the graphical tools are nice, the command line tool is actually easier
to use.  It's strongly recommended that you use the command line tool.</P>
<P>There are many inter-related modules, so make sure that you've got the
main package for each one, and not a sub package for an unrelated item.  For
example, there are many modules that have "perl" in them; some are a part of
the apache web server, others are a part of the perl distribution.  In each
case, we're looking to make sure that the primary module is getting
installed.</P>
<P>Click the magnifying glass or press <B>CTRL-F</B> and enter "perl" as your
search term.  You should find it under the "Perl" folder.  You need at least
the perl 5.80 base package installed.  If not, click on the "Mark" button.</P>
<P>If you are going to be installing MySQL on this system, search for mysql -
it should be under "Databases".  Make sure that mysql and mysql-clients are
installed.  If not, click on "Mark".</P>
<P>Search for gcc.  You're going to need gcc and gcc-c++ installed.</P>
<P>Search for freetype2.  Make sure that you've got freetype2 and
freetype2-devel installed.</P>
<P>Search for XFree86-devel.</P>
<P>Finally, check for qt.  You'll need libqt3-devel (under folder "KDE and
Qt") and libqt3 ("Libraries").</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="warning.eps">
<IMG SRC="warning.png">
<CAPTION>NOTE for Mandrake users:  In versions after Mandrake 9.1, Mandrake
removed the MySQL modules from the default installation.  Ensure that you
install libqt3-mysql.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>
</P>
<P>Make sure that cdialog is installed if you want to use MythTV with a remote
control if you need to compile <B>lirc</B> from source.</P>
<P>alsa-utils is needed for setting the volume.  MythTV now has native volume
support, but you may have a special configuration that necessitates an
external program to adjust your volume settings.  If this is the case, then
you can disable native volume support.</P>
<P>If you marked anything to install, click on Install Marked.  Click "Yes" or
OK if you get a message about satisfying dependencies.</P>

<H3><A NAME="CLIinstalltools_"></A> Command-line installation </H3>

<P> This section details the various methods for installing prerequisites
from the command line.</P>

<H3>Mandrake</H3>

<P><B>urpmi</B> is the simplest tool for installation of packages from the
command line, but properly configuring it can be difficult.  The
following website 
<A HREF="http://addmedia.linuxfornewbies.org/">http://addmedia.linuxfornewbies.org/</A> will allow you to choose
a mirror site and then present the command-line configuration text for that
mirror.  You will most likely need to add a "Contrib" mirror to your setup. 
If you add a site from the "Penguin Liberation Front", you will be able to
load the <CODE>lame</CODE> library without compiling from source.</P>

<H3>Mandrake 9.0</H3>

<P>The simplest tool for installing packages from the command line is
<B>urpmi</B>.</P>
<P>Open a shell, and execute the following, all on the same line. You may get
asked a number of questions regarding dependencies.  It's best to answer
"YES".
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# urpmi mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel cdialog alsa-utils
# urpmi XFree86-devel perl
# urpmi libqt3-devel
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
NOTE for Mandrake 9.1+ users: execute the following command.

# urpmi libqt3-mysql
</PRE>
<HR>

However, you might get this when you execute the command above:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[root@pvr root]# urpmi mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel libqt3-devel alsa-utils XFree86-devel perl
everything already installed
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In that case, you're ready to move to the next 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-4.html#Setting_up_paths">section</A>.  Once you have completed installing the pre-requisites,
exit out of the shell and start a new one to ensure that any environment
variables setup by the installation have a chance to take effect.</P>
<H3>Gentoo. </H3>

<P>If Qt has not been installed on your system: Edit
<CODE>/etc/make.conf</CODE> and locate the "USE" variable. If the line is
commented out, remove the comment. The line should have at least:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
USE="mysql alsa"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Next you need to build Qt. If you don't plan on using the ebuilds as 
described in the Gentoo section then you also need to install lame.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# emerge lame mysql qt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you have already installed Qt: you will need to rebuild because the
default installation doesn't include MySQL support, a requirement for MythTV.  
To enable SQL support, add "mysql" to your USE variable in 
<CODE>/etc/make.conf</CODE> and rebuild Qt by running
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# emerge qt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>All the necessary files will be downloaded and built. Even on a fast machine
this may take a lot of time if you need to do a full Qt build.</P>
