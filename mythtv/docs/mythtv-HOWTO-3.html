<P>You must ensure that any firewalls (either hardware, or a software
firewall installed by your distribution) will not block access to the ports
that will be used by the MythTV clients and servers on the "inside" LAN. 
The ports for MySQL (TCP port 3306) and mythbackend (TCP ports 6543 and
6544) must be open.  It is <EM>strongly</EM> recommended that you do
<EM>not</EM> expose the MythTV and MySQL ports to the Internet or your
"Outside" LAN.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc3.1">Hardware. </A>
</H2>

<P>Hardware selection is a complex topic, one this HOWTO will only discuss
briefly and in general terms. The following subsections offer some general 
guidance but stop short of offering specific recommendations.</P>
<P>For more detail about actual configurations that others have used, Mark
Cooper has setup a hardware database at 
<A HREF="http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/">http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/</A>. The
website will let you browse what other users have reported as their hardware
configuration, and how happy they are with the results.</P>
<P>If you have specific questions about the suitability of specific hardware
choices, you can consult the archives of the mythtv-users mailing list at
<A HREF="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/archive/MythTV_C2/Users_F11/">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/archive/MythTV_C2/Users_F11/</A> or
post a question to the list.</P>
<H3>CPU Type and Speed</H3>

<P>Selection of CPU type and speed is one of the trickiest elements of
hardware selection, mainly because there are so many tradeoffs which can be
made.  For example, if you have plenty of CPU, you can use higher bitrates
or capture sizes, etc.</P>
<P>MythTV has two modes of operation.  First, it can function as a software video
encoder, which means that it uses a fairly generic "dumb" video capture card
to get frames of video, encodes them using the CPU on your motherboard and
writes them to disk.  High-end video capture cards and devices like the TiVo
and ReplayTV have dedicated encoder chips which use specialized hardware to
convert the video stream to the MPEG-2 format without using the motherboard
CPU.  The main CPU has the responsibility of running the Operating System
and reading and writing the encoded frames to the disk.  These tasks have
fairly low CPU requirements compared to encoding video, which is why a
device like a Series 1 TiVo can run with only 16MB of RAM and a 54MHz CPU.</P>
<P>There are many variables that go into the question: "How fast a CPU do I
need to run MythTV"?  Obviously, the faster your CPU, the better your
experience will be with MythTV.  If you are using the software MPEG-4
encoder and performing the "Watch TV" function, where the CPU is both
encoding and decoding video simultaneously to allow Pause, Fast Forward and
Rewind functions for live TV requires more CPU then just encoding or
decoding.  MythTV also supports multiple encoder cards in a single PC,
thereby increasing the CPU requirements if you plan on simultaneously
encoding multiple programs.  As a general guideline, plan on 1GHz per
encoder.</P>
<P>Here are a few data points:
<UL>
<LI>A PIII/733MHz system can encode one video stream using the MPEG-4
codec using 480x480 capture resolution.  This does not allow for live TV
watching, but does allow for encoding video and then watching it later.</LI>
<LI>The developer states that his AMD1800+ system can <B>almost</B>
encode two MPEG-4 video streams and watch one program simultaneously.</LI>
<LI>A PIII/800MHz system with 512MB RAM can encode one video
stream using the RTjpeg codec with 480x480 capture resolution and play it back
simultaneously, thereby allowing live TV watching.</LI>
<LI>A dual Celeron/450MHz is able to view a 480x480 MPEG-4/3300kbps file
created on a different system with 30% CPU usage.</LI>
<LI>A P4 2.4GHz machine can encode two 3300Kbps 480x480 MPEG-4 files and
simultaneously serve content to a remote frontend.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The second mode of operation is where MythTV is paired with a hardware-based
video encoder, such as a Matrox G200 or a Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-250/350.  In
this mode, because the video encoding is being done by a dedicated video
processor, the host CPU requirements are quite low.  See the 
<A HREF="#video_capture_device">Video Capture Device</A> section for details.</P>
<P>If you have a Via M10000 series or a Hauppauge PVR-350, MythTV can use the
hardware-based video decoder for playback, which further reduces CPU
requirements.</P>

<H3>Memory</H3>

<P>A MythTV host that is both a backend and a frontend and using software
encoding with a single capture card should run adequately in 256MB of RAM.
Additional RAM above 256MB will not necessarily increase performance, but
may be useful if you are running multiple encoders.</P>

<H3>Hard Disk(s)</H3>

<P>Encoded video takes up a lot of hard disk space. The exact amount depends
on the encoding scheme, the size of the raw images, and the frames per
second, but typical values for MythTV range from 700 megabytes/hour to 2
gigabyte/hour for MPEG-4 and larger for MPEG-2 and RTjpeg.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  You <EM>must</EM> use DMA for hard drive access to prevent
choppy or jittery video.  Not all distributions enable DMA at boot time. 
See the Troubleshooting Section for 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-20.html#Setting_DMA">instructions</A> on how to do this.</P>
<P>Writing video to disk is sensitive to timing issues; RTjpeg requires less
CPU with the tradeoff being larger files and needing to write to the disk
faster.  MPEG-4 requires more CPU, but the files are smaller.  At the
default resolution, MPEG-2 creates the largest files of all with almost no
CPU impact.</P>
<P>See the Troubleshooting 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-20.html#Setting_DMA">section</A> for more
information.</P>

<H3>Filesystems</H3>

<P>MythTV creates large files, many in excess of 2GB.  You <EM>must</EM> use a
filesystem that will allow you to create large files.  Filesystems known to
have problems with large files are FAT and FAT32.</P>
<P>Because of the size of these files, it may be useful to plan for future
expansion right from the beginning.  If your case and power supply have the
capability for additional hard drives, read through the 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-22.html#LVM">LVM</A> and 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-22.html#advancedpartitionformatting">Advanced Partition Formatting</A> sections for some pointers.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="video_capture_device"></A> </P>
<H3>Video Capture Device </H3>

<P>In order to capture video, MythTV will need one or more video capture
devices with Linux drivers.  There are a number of classes of hardware
available for capturing video.  </P>
<H3>Frame Grabbers.</H3>

<P>This class of card is the simplest and is usually the cheapest.  There is no
on-board encoding of the analog video; hardware known as a Digital-Analog
Converter (DAC) takes the video and presents it to the computer in an
essentially raw digital form.</P>
<P>For a list of video capture cards known to work
with Linux, please see
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv</CODE> for a partial
listing; even if your specific card is not listed, it may be that the vendor
is actually using a standard reference design and placing their own name on
it.  See the video4linux mailing list (
<A HREF="https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list">https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list</A>) for
more information and for specific hardware questions.  </P>
<P>The most common inexpensive cards available use the Bt848 or Bt878 video
capture chip; examples are the "Hauppauge WinTV Go" card and the "AverTV
Desktop PVR" card, both of which use the bttv kernel module.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
NOTE:  The ATI TV Wonder series and the ATI All-in-Wonder series of cards
are not the same.  The All-in-Wonder cards will not work with MythTV.
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: The ATI All-in-Wonder cards (which are not the same as the ATI
TV Wonder, TV Wonder VE or TV Wonder Pro) <EM>will not</EM> work as a MythTV
capture device because the GATOS 
<A HREF="http://gatos.sourceforge.net">http://gatos.sourceforge.net</A>
drivers that are available provide only a limited subset of the V4L API. 
The TV Wonder series of cards are supported by the Bt8x8 Video4Linux driver.</P>
<P>Newer cards may use the CX23881 series of chips; a driver is available at
<A HREF="http://bytesex.org/cx88/">http://bytesex.org/cx88/</A>.</P>
<P>After you have installed a suitable capture device, you can check that 
the kernel sees it with <CODE>lspci</CODE>. Look for an entry labeled "Multimedia 
video controller". To get more detailed information about the card, use 
<CODE>lspci -v</CODE> or <CODE>lspci -vv</CODE>.  Ensure that your system is loading
the bttv modules by typing:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# lsmod |grep bttv
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You want to see the <CODE>bttv</CODE> module listed.</P>
<H3>Hardware MPEG-2 encoders.</H3>

<P>While inexpensive video-capture cards just capture raw frames, leaving
encoding to software, some higher-end cards incorporate hardware-level
encoding. Using either a G200 MJPEG encoder card, or a MPEG-2 encoder card
supported by the IvyTV project 
<A HREF="http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/">http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/</A> such as the Hauppauge PVR-250, PVR-350,
Avermedia M179, Hauppauge "Freestyle" or Yuan M600 cards will allow you to
use dedicated hardware encoders rather than your CPU. Release 0.14 of MythTV
is able to use these MPEG-2 encoders as an input device for live TV and for
scheduled recordings.  (The PVR-350 can simultaneously be used as an output
device.) Using the on-board MPEG-2 encoder drastically reduces the CPU
requirements for encoding.</P>
<P>Here are some data points for encoding:
<UL>
<LI>A Celeron 450 uses 2% CPU for encoding a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 stream.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Here are some data points for decoding:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>An Athlon 1800XP can decode a 720x480 8Mbps MPEG-2 file using 10% CPU</LI>
<LI>An Athlon 1GHz can decode a 720x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file using 30-50%
CPU, can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 using 30% CPU and approximately 30%
for Live TV at 416x480.</LI>
<LI>A P3-550 can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file with 55% CPU.</LI>
<LI>A Celeron 450 (no SSE) can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file with
80% CPU.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>See the 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-22.html#pvr250">Hauppauge PVR-250/350 hardware MPEG-2 encoder.</A>
section for information on installing a PVR-250 on Mandrake 9.1.  The
information contained in the section will also apply to other MPEG-2 encoder cards
supported by the IVTV driver.</P>
<H3>DVB capture cards.</H3>

<P>DVB is a video standard primarily found in Europe.  MythTV supports DVB;
see the pages maintained by Martin Smith 
<A HREF="mailto:martin@ethics-gradient.net">martin@ethics-gradient.net</A> at 
<A HREF="http://www.ethics-gradient.net/myth/mythdvb.html">http://www.ethics-gradient.net/myth/mythdvb.html</A> for more
information.  To see if your DVB card is supported, see the list of cards at
<A HREF="http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb/CARDS">http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb/CARDS</A> for more information.</P>
<P>There are no known satellite systems available in the United States which
will allow you to use a DVB card and obtain an unencrypted stream suitable
for use with MythTV.</P>
<H3>HDTV.</H3>

<P>Currently there is only one HDTV card with Linux drivers which is known
to operate in the United States - the card available from 
<A HREF="http://www.pchdtv.com/">http://www.pchdtv.com/</A>.  This card can
only be used to capture over-the-air HDTV.  There are no known capture
devices which will allow you to capture the HDTV output from a set-top box
commonly found with digital cable systems or satellite systems.</P>
<H3>Hardware known NOT to work and other issues.</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Hauppauge WinTV-D or -HD (no driver)</LI>
<LI>Hauppauge WinTV-USB series</LI>
<LI>Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-usb, usb2 or PCI cards (no driver - this is not the PVR-250/350
series of cards supported by the IvyTV driver)</LI>
<LI>ATI All-in-Wonder series</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>There are no known capture cards for digital cable.  You must use the
set-top box provided by your digital cable provider and capture the analog
video output using either composite or S-Video.</P>
<P>There are no known capture cards for HDTV content.</P>
<P>There are no known capture cards for component (RGB or YPbPr)
video.</P>
<H3>Sound card</H3>

<P>The system needs a sound card or an on-board equivalent on the motherboard
to play back and in most cases, to record sound. Any sound card that can be
operated by the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) kernel modules will
work with MythTV.  However, some cards and drivers will provide better
quality or compatibility than others.  In particular, many audio
devices included on motherboards can be problematic.</P>
<P>The usual practice for capturing the audio associated with the video
is to run a cable from an audio output on the video capture card to
the Line input on a sound card. However, some video capture cards
provide on-board audio capabilities that work with the kernel
<CODE>btaudio</CODE> module instead, thereby eliminating the need for a
cable.  This is useful if you will be using multiple capture cards in
a single chassis, since each capture card will not need its own sound
card.  Note that a separate sound card is still required for playback
when using <CODE>btaudio</CODE>, and that often the audio recorded in this
way will be mono only.  See the 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-21.html#btaudio">btaudio</A>
section for more information.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  The MPEG-2 cards supported by the IVTV driver do not require
a sound card for audio capture.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Plugging a Line-level device into the Mic input is not
recommended.  Line-level devices have higher voltages and can damage the
sound card.  In addition, even if it doesn't break your card, you will be
getting Mono sound.  See the Linux MP3 HOWTO at 
<A HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/html_single/MP3-HOWTO.html#toc8">http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/html_single/MP3-HOWTO.html#toc8</A>
for additional information.</P>

<H3>Video Display Card</H3>

<P>MythTV will work with just about any video card.  However, it is highly
recommended that you use a card which supports XVideo (XV) extensions. If
your card does not support XV, color conversion and scaling will be
performed by your CPU rather than the video card.  This is very CPU
and memory intensive and will often result in dropped frames and a
corresponding degradation of quality.  Check the XFree86 documentation
for details if you are uncertain about your preferred card.  You may
also run <CODE>xvinfo</CODE>; look for your video card to be listed as one
of the adapters.</P>

<P>If you want to use MythTV with a standard television, you will need a
physical connection from your video card to your TV set, which can either be
a TV-out port on the card itself or an external adapter that converts the
VGA signal to an appropriate video signal. "Appropriate" depends on a number
of factors, such as video standard (NTSC vs PAL) type of input connection
(Composite vs SVideo), etc.</P>
<P>Note that with some video cards and X drivers, XVideo extensions are
only supported on the VGA output, and not on the TV output.</P>

<H3>Cards with TV out</H3>

<P>The next section deals with a number of cards that are known to have
TV-out ports.  The list is unlikely to be complete, so if you know of
others, please post a message to the mythtv-users mailing list so the
information can be included in future versions of the HOWTO. The list is
organized by manufacturer.</P>
<P>Reports here are based on what users of the cards have posted on the
mythtv-users mailing list, so if you need configuration details, please
search the archives at 
<A HREF="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/archive/MythTV_C2/Users_F11/">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/archive/MythTV_C2/Users_F11/</A> using
the card name in your search string.</P>

<H3>ATI</H3>

<P>ATI makes many cards with TV-out capability, but ATI offers no official
support for their use with Linux. The standard XFree86 ati driver does not
support TV-out.</P>
<P>The enhanced ati.2 X driver created by the GATOS 
<A HREF="http://gatos.sourceforge.net">http://gatos.sourceforge.net</A>
project offers some support for TV-out, but only in its "experimental"
version, available through CVS. There have been reports from people who say
they have made this driver work with one or another ATI card. For example,
Bruce Markey 
<A HREF="mailto:bjm@lvcm.com">mailto:bjm@lvcm.com</A> writes (on the mythtv-users
mailing list): "I got this to work. You can quote me on that. I've used
TV-out on several models of ATI cards both All-In-Wonder and regular cards
with TV-out." See the "Adventurous Setup" section of 
<A HREF="http://gatos.sourceforge.net/watching_tv.php">http://gatos.sourceforge.net/watching_tv.php</A> for details. Also see

<H3>Matrox</H3>

<P>The standard Matrox driver included with XFree86 does not support TV-out.</P>
<P>Older Matrox cards can be used with a proprietary X driver provided by 
Matrox, and it does simultaneously support TV out and XVideo on some cards. 
See 
<A HREF="http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/files/lnx_21.cfm">http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/files/lnx_21.cfm</A> for details.</P>
<P>Newer Matrox cards can be run with a set of kernel patches (for kernel 
2.4.19) and a customized X driver, but this arrangement does not support 
XVideo on TV-out. See 
<A HREF="http://www.bglug.ca/matrox_tvout/g450_tvout_howto.html">http://www.bglug.ca/matrox_tvout/g450_tvout_howto.html</A> for details.</P>

<H3>NVIDIA</H3>

<P>Some NVIDIA cards with TV-out can be run using the standard nv driver in 
XFree86, combined with the userspace application <B>nvtv</B> to control the TV-out 
port. See 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/</A> for details.  Recent
versions of the NVIDIA driver have better support for overscan and other
features useful with TV-Out, so the <B>nvtv</B> application may not be
required.</P>
<P>Some NVIDIA cards can be run with a proprietary NVIDIA X driver made
available by NVIDIA. See 
<A HREF="http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=linux">http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=linux</A> for more information.</P>
<P>Specific cards:

<H3>Savage</H3>

<P>The standard savage X driver supports TV out on some Savage cards. 
Unfortunately, XVideo support for the Savage 2000 card (a very common and 
inexpensive Savage card with TV out) is broken. See 
<A HREF="http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html">http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html</A> for details.</P>

<H3>Hauppauge PVR-350</H3>

<P>MythTV supports the TV-out and MPEG-2 decoder functions in the IvyTV driver.</P>

<H3>Other Options</H3>

<P>Some devices with on-board TV-out capability, such as XBoxes converted to 
Linux and some laptops, can be used as MythTV frontends to display on a 
television screen. Please consult the mythtv-users mailing list for messages 
that report the details of these special arrangements.</P>

<H3>External Adapters</H3>

<P>External adapters convert standard VGA output to a form suitable for 
display on a television. The output format varies by region, since 
different countries have different TV standards. People on the mythtv-users 
list have mentioned these adapters:</P>

for <B>ALSA</B>, capture cards, <B>lirc</B>, etc., nor do they set up
your MythTV database. Check 
<A HREF="http://atrpms.physik.fu-berlin.de/topic/multimedia/">ATrpms</A> for
the drivers you need.</P>

<H3>Mandrake</H3>

<P>Thac has created RPMs for MythTV for Mandrake 9.0 and 9.1 which may be
obtained from 
<A HREF="http://rpm.nyvalls.se/">http://rpm.nyvalls.se/</A> If you have problems with the RPMs, please
send him email directly at 
<A HREF="thac@nyvalls.se">thac@nyvalls.se</A>.</P>

<H3>Debian</H3>

<P>Debian packages for MythTV and most of its add-on
modules are maintained by Matt Zimmerman 
<A HREF="mailto:mdz@debian.org">mailto:mdz@debian.org</A> and are available at 
<A HREF="http://dijkstra.csh.rit.edu/~mdz/debian/dists/woody/mythtv/">http://dijkstra.csh.rit.edu/~mdz/debian/dists/woody/mythtv/</A>
(for Debian 3.0/woody) and 
<A HREF="http://dijkstra.csh.rit.edu/~mdz/debian/dists/unstable/mythtv/">http://dijkstra.csh.rit.edu/~mdz/debian/dists/unstable/mythtv/</A>
(for unstable).  Be sure to use the appropriate packages for your
system; the woody packages cannot be installed on unstable, nor vice
versa.  Installation instructions can be found on those pages as well.
All of the prerequisites for MythTV are available as Debian packages,
most of them from the official Debian archive.</P>

<P>If you are running woody, be sure to follow the instructions on the
above page to ensure that the MySQL server starts up immediately after
it is installed.  If you are running unstable, this is the default
behavior.</P>

<P>The Debian packages are configured such that MythTV programs should be
run as the <CODE>mythtv</CODE> user, which is automatically created during
installation.  This user has access to write new recordings to disk in
the default directory, read and write the database, access the audio
and video devices, and everything else that MythTV needs to do.</P>

<P>See <CODE>/usr/share/doc/<I>packagename</I>/README.Debian</CODE> for
more information, including copies of the MythTV documentation.  The
<CODE>mythtv-doc</CODE> package contains a copy of this HOWTO in
<CODE>/usr/share/doc/mythtv-doc</CODE>.</P>

<H3>Manual installation</H3>

<P>You may use the graphical tools that come with your distribution, or you
can use command-line utilities.  Either system will get the job done, and it
all depends on your comfort level with Linux.</P>
<P>In order to compile MythTV, we need to make sure that the software it needs
is installed.  As of 2003-03-15, this list includes <B>mysql</B>,
<B>gcc</B>, <B>freetype2-devel</B>, <B>XFree86-devel</B>,
<B>qt-devel</B> and <B>lame</B>.  If you're going to use a remote
control with MythTV, you're going to need the <B>cdialog</B> package in
order to compile <B>lircd</B> if your distribution doesn't have a
pre-packaged <B>lirc</B>.  If you are using <B>XMLTV</B> as a grabber,
you will need <B>perl</B>.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
NOTE:  Qt v3.1 is required.

NOTE:  If you are going to be using RPMs to install various
components, you should be aware that not all packages include the necessary
headers for compiling packages.  If you're having trouble compiling, ensure
that you've installed the -devel version of a prerequisite.

NOTE:  Other than where noted, Mandrake 9.1 users may follow the
Mandrake 9.0 instructions.
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>There appears to be issues with ALSA and simultaneously recording and
playing sound, which is a core requirement for MythTV.  If you are not
running ALSA 0.9.0rc6 or higher and experience lock-ups of your system when
trying to use MythTV, then please check the main ALSA website and upgrade to
the latest version, or see if your distribution has already packaged the
latest ALSA drivers.</P>

<H3><A NAME="graphicinstalltools_"></A> Graphical installation tools. </H3>

<H3>Mandrake 9.0</H3>

<P>On systems running KDE, a tool which will allow you to see what packages
are available and if they're installed on your system can be accessed by
clicking K->Configuration->Packaging->KPackage</P>
<P>While the graphical tools are nice, the command line tool is actually easier
to use.  It's strongly recommended that you use the command line tool.</P>
<P>There are many inter-related modules, so make sure that you've got the
main package for each one, and not a sub package for an unrelated item.  For
example, there are many modules that have "perl" in them; some are a part of
the apache web server, others are a part of the perl distribution.  In each
case, we're looking to make sure that the primary module is getting
installed.</P>
<P>Click the magnifying glass or press <B>CTRL-F</B> and enter "perl" as your
search term.  You should find it under the "Perl" folder.  You need at least
the perl 5.80 base package installed.  If not, click on the "Mark" button.</P>
<P>If you are going to be installing mysql on this system, search for mysql -
it should be under "Databases".  Make sure that mysql and mysql-clients are
installed.  If not, click on "Mark".</P>
<P>Search for gcc.  You're going to need gcc and gcc-c++ installed.</P>
<P>Search for freetype2.  Make sure that you've got freetype2 and
freetype2-devel installed.</P>
<P>Search for XFree86-devel.</P>
<P>Finally, check for qt.  You'll need libqt3-devel (under folder "KDE and
Qt") and libqt3 ("Libraries").</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
NOTE for Mandrake 9.1 users:  Mandrake 9.1 has removed the MySQL modules
from the default installation.  Ensure that you install libqt3-mysql.
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>Make sure that cdialog is installed if you want to use MythTV with a remote
control if you need to compile <B>lirc</B> from source.</P>
<P>alsa-utils is needed for setting the volume.  MythTV now has native volume
support, but you may have a special configuration that necessitates an
external program to adjust your volume settings.  If this is the case, then
you can disable native volume support.</P>
<P>If you marked anything to install, click on Install Marked.  Click "Yes" or
OK if you get a message about satisfying dependencies.</P>

<H3><A NAME="CLIinstalltools_"></A> Command-line installation. </H3>

<P> This section details the various methods for installing prerequisites
from the command line.</P>

<H3>Mandrake</H3>

<P><B>urpmi</B> is the simplest tool for installation of packages from the
command line, but properly configuring it can be difficult.  The
following website 
<A HREF="http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php">http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php</A> will allow you to choose
a mirror site and then present the command-line configuration text for that
mirror.  You will most likely need to add a "Contrib" mirror to your setup. 
If you add a site from the "Penguin Liberation Front", you will be able to
load the <CODE>lame</CODE> library without compiling from source.</P>

<H3>Mandrake 9.0</H3>

<P>The simplest tool for installing packages from the command line is
<B>urpmi</B>.</P>
<P>Open a shell, and execute the following, all on the same line. You may get
asked a number of questions regarding dependencies.  It's best to answer
"YES".
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# urpmi mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel cdialog alsa-utils
# urpmi XFree86-devel perl
# urpmi libqt3-devel
</PRE>

</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
NOTE for Mandrake 9.1 users: execute the following command.

# urpmi libqt3-mysql
</PRE>
<HR>

However, you might get this when you execute the command above:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[root@pvr root]# urpmi mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel libqt3-devel alsa-utils XFree86-devel perl
everything already installed
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In that case, you're ready to move to the next 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-4.html#Setting_up_paths">section</A>.</P>
<H3>Gentoo. </H3>

<P>If Qt has not been installed on your system: Edit
<CODE>/etc/make.conf</CODE> and locate the "USE" variable. If the line is
commented out, remove the comment. The line should have at least:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
USE="mysql alsa"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Next you need to build Qt. If you don't plan on using the ebuilds as 
described in the Gentoo section then you also need to install lame.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# emerge lame mysql qt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you have already installed Qt: you will need to rebuild because the
default installation doesn't include mysql support, a requirement for MythTV.  
To enable SQL support, add "mysql" to your USE variable in 
<CODE>/etc/make.conf</CODE> and rebuild Qt by running
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# emerge qt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>All the necessary files will be downloaded and built. Even on a fast machine
this may take a lot of time if you need to do a full Qt build.</P>
