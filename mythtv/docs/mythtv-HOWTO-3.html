<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc3.1">Hardware. </A>
</H2>

<P>Hardware selection is a complex topic, one this HOWTO will only discuss
briefly and in general terms. The following subsections offer some general 
guidance but stop short of offering specific recommendations.</P>
<P>For more detail about actual configurations that others have used, Mark
Cooper has setup a hardware database at 
<A HREF="http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/">http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/</A>. The
website will let you browse what other users have reported as their hardware
configuration, and how happy they are with the results.</P>
<P>If you have specific questions about the suitability of specific hardware
choices, you can consult the archives of the mythtv-users mailing list or
post a question to the list.</P>
<H3>CPU Type and Speed</H3>

<P>Selection of CPU type and speed is one of the trickiest elements of
hardware selection, mainly because there are so many tradeoffs which can be
made.  For example, if you have plenty of CPU, you can use higher bitrates
or capture sizes, etc.</P>
<P>MythTV has two modes of operation.  First, it can function as a software video
encoder, which means that it uses a fairly generic "dumb" video capture card
to get frames of video, encodes them using the CPU on your motherboard and
writes them to disk.  High-end video capture cards and devices like the Tivo
and ReplayTV have dedicated encoder chips which use specialized hardware to
convert the video stream to the MPEG-2 format without using the motherboard
CPU.  The main CPU has the responsibility of running the Operating System
and reading and writing the encoded frames to the disk.  These tasks have
fairly low CPU requirements compared to encoding video, which is why a
device like a Series 1 Tivo can run with only 16MB of RAM and a 54MHz CPU.</P>
<P>There are many variables that go into the question: "How fast a CPU do I
need to run MythTV"?  Obviously, the faster your CPU, the better your
experience will be with MythTV.  If you are using the software MPEG-4
encoder and performing the "Watch TV" function, where the CPU is both
encoding and decoding video simultaneously to allow Pause, Fast Forward and
Rewind functions for live TV requires more CPU then just encoding or
decoding.  MythTV also supports multiple encoder cards in a single PC,
thereby increasing the CPU requirements if you plan on simultaneously
encoding multiple programs.  As a general guideline, plan on 1GHz per
encoder.</P>
<P>Here are a few data points:
<UL>
<LI>A PIII/733MHz system can encode one video stream using the MPEG-4
codec using 480x480 capture resolution.  This does not allow for live TV
watching, but does allow for encoding video and then watching it later.</LI>
<LI>The developer states that his AMD1800+ system can <B>almost</B>
encode two MPEG-4 video streams and watch one program simultaneously.</LI>
<LI>A PIII/800MHz system with 512MB RAM can encode one video
stream using the RTJPEG codec with 480x480 capture resolution and play it back
simultaneously, thereby allowing live TV watching.</LI>
<LI>A dual Celeron/450MHz is able to view a 480x480 MPEG-4/3300kbps file
created on a different system with 30% CPU usage.</LI>
<LI>A P4 2.4GHz machine can encode two 3300Kbps 480x480 MPEG-4 files and
simultaneously serve content to a remote frontend.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The second mode of operation is where MythTV is paired with a hardware-based
video encoder, such as a Matrox G200 or a Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-250/350.  In
this mode, because the video encoding is being done externally, the CPU
requirements are quite low.  See the 
<A HREF="#video_capture_device">Video Capture Device</A> section for details.</P>

<H3>Memory</H3>

<P>A MythTV host that is both a backend and a frontend and using software
encoding with a single capture card should run adequately in 256MB of RAM.
Additional RAM above 256MB will not necessarily increase performance, but
may be useful if you are running multiple encoders.</P>

<H3>Hard Disk(s)</H3>

<P>Encoded video takes up a lot of hard disk space. The exact amount depends
on the encoding scheme, the size of the raw images, and the frames per
second, but typical values for MythTV range from 700 megabytes/hour to 2
gigabyte/hour for MPEG-4 and larger for MPEG-2 and RTJPEG.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  You <EM>must</EM> use DMA for hard drive access to prevent
choppy or jittery video.  Red Hat Linux 8.0 apparently does not enable DMA
at boot time.  See the Troubleshooting Section for 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-18.html#Setting_DMA">instructions</A> on how to do this.</P>
<P>Writing video to disk is sensitive to timing issues; RTJPEG requires less
CPU with the tradeoff being larger files and needing to write to the disk
faster.  MPEG-4 requires more CPU, but the files are smaller.  At the
default resolution, MPEG-2 creates the largest files of all with almost no
CPU impact.</P>
<P>See the Troubleshooting 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-18.html#Setting_DMA">section</A> for more
information.</P>

<H3>Filesystems</H3>

<P>MythTV creates large files, many in excess of 2GB.  You <EM>must</EM> use a
filesystem that will allow you to create large files.  Filesystems known to
have problems with large files are FAT and FAT32.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="video_capture_device"></A> </P>
<H3>Video Capture Device </H3>

<P>In order to watch live TV, MythTV will need one or more video capture
devices with Linux drivers.  For a list of video capture cards known to work
with Linux, please see
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv</CODE> for a partial
listing; even if your specific card is not listed, it may be that the vendor
is actually using a standard reference design and placing their own name on
it.  See the video4linux mailing list (
<A HREF="https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list">https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list</A>) for
more information and for specific hardware questions.  </P>
<P>The most common inexpensive cards available use the Bt848 or Bt878 video
capture chip; examples are the "Hauppauge WinTV Go" card and the "AverTV
Desktop PVR" card, both of which use the bttv kernel module.</P>
<P>Newer cards may use the CX23881 series of chips; a driver is available at
<A HREF="http://bytesex.org/cx88/">http://bytesex.org/cx88/</A>.</P>
<P>After you have installed a suitable capture device, you can check that 
the kernel sees it with <CODE>lspci</CODE>. Look for an entry labeled "Multimedia 
video controller". To get more detailed information about the card, use 
<CODE>lspci -v</CODE> or <CODE>lspci -vv</CODE>.  Ensure that your system is loading
the bttv modules by typing:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# lsmod |grep bttv
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You want to see the <CODE>bttv</CODE> module listed.</P>
<P>While inexpensive video-capture cards just capture raw frames, leaving
encoding to software, some higher-end cards incorporate hardware-level
encoding. Using either a G200 MJPEG encoder card, or a WinTV-PVR-250 or 350
from Hauppauge and the driver from the IvyTV project 
<A HREF="http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/">http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/</A> will
allow you to use dedicated hardware encoders rather than your CPU. Release
0.10 of MythTV is able to use the PVR-250/350 cards as an input device for
live TV and for scheduled recordings.  Using the onboard MPEG-2 encoder
drastically reduces the CPU requirements for encoding.</P>
<P>Here are some data points for encoding:
<UL>
<LI>A Celeron 450 uses 2% CPU for encoding a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 stream.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Here are some data points for decoding:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>An Athlon 1800XP can decode a 720x480 8Mbps MPEG-2 file using 10% CPU</LI>
<LI>An Athlon 1GHz can decode a 720x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file using 30-50%
CPU, can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 using 30% CPU and approximately 30%
for Live TV at 416x480.</LI>
<LI>A P3-550 can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file with 55% CPU.</LI>
<LI>A Celeron 450 (no SSE) can decode a 480x480 16Mbps MPEG-2 file with
80% CPU.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>See the 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-19.html#pvr250">I'd like to use a hardware MPEG-2 encoder</A>
section for information on installing a PVR-250 on Mandrake 9.1.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: The ATI All-in-Wonder cards <EM>will not</EM> work as a
MythTV capture device, as the 
<A HREF="http://gatos.sourceforge.net">GATOS</A> drivers that are available provide only a limited subset
of the V4L API.</P>

<H3>Sound card</H3>

<P>The system needs a sound card or an onboard equivalent on the motherboard
to play back and in most cases, to record sound. Any sound card that can be
operated by the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) kernel modules will
work with MythTV.  However, some cards and drivers will provide better
quality or compatibility than others.  In particular, many audio
devices included on motherboards can be problematic.</P>
<P>The usual practice for capturing the audio associated with the video
is to run a cable from an audio output on the video capture card to
the Line input on a sound card. However, some video capture cards
provide onboard audio capabilities that work with the kernel
<CODE>btaudio</CODE> module instead, thereby eliminating the need for a
cable.  This is useful if you will be using multiple capture cards in
a single chassis, since each capture card will not need its own sound
card.  Note that a separate sound card is still required for playback
when using <CODE>btaudio</CODE>, and that often the audio recorded in this
way will be mono only.  See the 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-19.html#btaudio">btaudio</A>
section for more information.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  The PVR-250/350 does not require a sound card for audio
capture.</P>

<H3>Video Display Card</H3>

<P>MythTV will work with just about any video card.  However, it is highly
recommended that you use a card which supports XVideo (XV) extensions. If
your card does not support XV, color conversion and scaling will be
performed by your CPU rather than the video card.  This is very CPU
and memory intensive and will often result in dropped frames and a
corresponding degradation of quality.  Check the XFree86 documentation
for details if you are uncertain about your preferred card.  You may
also run <CODE>xvinfo</CODE>; look for your video card to be listed as one
of the adapters.</P>

<P>If you want to use MythTV with a standard television, you will need a
physical connection from your video card to your TV set, which can
either be a TV-out port on the card itself, or an external adapter that
converts the VGA signal to an appropriate video signal. "Appropriate"
depends on a number of factors, such as video standard (NTSC vs PAL) type of
input connection (Composite vs SVideo), etc.</P>
<P>Note that with some video cards and X drivers, Xvideo extensions are
only supported on the VGA output, and not on the TV output.</P>

<H3>Cards with TV out</H3>

<P>The next section deals with a number of cards that are known to have
TV-out ports.  The list is unlikely to be complete, so if you know of
others, please post a message to the mythtv-users mailing list so the
information can be included in future versions of the HOWTO. The list is
organized by manufacturer.</P>
<P>Reports here are based on what users of the cards have posted on the
mythtv-users mailing list, so if you need configuration details, please
search the archives at 
<A HREF="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/archive/MythTV_C2/Users_F11/">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/archive/MythTV_C2/Users_F11/</A> using
the card name in your search string.</P>

<H3>ATI</H3>

<P>ATI makes many cards with TV-out capability, but ATI offers no official
support for their use with Linux. The standard XFree86 ati driver does not
support TV-out.</P>
<P>The enhanced ati.2 X driver created by the GATOS 
<A HREF="http://gatos.sourceforge.net">http://gatos.sourceforge.net</A>
project offers some support for TV-out, but only in its "experimental"
version, available through CVS. There have been reports from people who say
they have made this driver work with one or another ATI card. For example,
Bruce Markey 
<A HREF="mailto:bjm@lvcm.com">mailto:bjm@lvcm.com</A> writes (on the mythtv-users
mailing list): "I got this to work. You can quote me on that. I've used
TV-out on several models of ATI cards both All-In-Wonder and regular cards
with TV-out." See the "Adventurous Setup" section of 
<A HREF="http://gatos.sourceforge.net/watching_tv.php">http://gatos.sourceforge.net/watching_tv.php</A> for details. Also see
<A HREF="http://www.retinalburn.net/linux/tvout.html">http://www.retinalburn.net/linux/tvout.html</A> for more information.</P>
<P>Specific cards:
<UL>
<LI>ATI Rage II+DVD (Mach 64). Ports not described. Reported to work, but no details reported.</LI>
<LI>Rage 128 VIVO. Ports not described. Reported to work, but no details reported.</LI>
<LI>Radeon 7500. Ports not described. Reported to work, but no details reported.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Matrox</H3>

<P>The standard Matrox driver included with XFree86 does not support TV-out.</P>
<P>Older Matrox cards can be used with a proprietary X driver provided by 
Matrox, and it does simultaneously support TV out and XVideo on some cards. 
See 
<A HREF="http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/files/lnx_21.cfm">http://www.matrox.com/mga/support/drivers/files/lnx_21.cfm</A> for details.</P>
<P>Newer Matrox cards can be run with a set of kernel patches (for kernel 
2.4.19) and a customized X driver, but this arrangement does not support 
XVideo on TV-out. See 
<A HREF="http://www.bglug.ca/matrox_tvout/g450_tvout_howto.html">http://www.bglug.ca/matrox_tvout/g450_tvout_howto.html</A> for details.</P>
<P>Specific cards:
<UL>
<LI>Matrox G400 AGP. Uses external adapter to provide Composite and
SVideo ports. Reported to work with the proprietary Matrox X driver.</LI>
<LI>Matrox Millennium 450GX AGP. Uses external adapter to provide
Composite and SVideo ports. TV-out implementation does <EM>NOT</EM> support XVideo.</LI>
<LI>Matrox Millennium 550GX AGP. Uses external adapter to provide
Composite and S-Video ports. TV-out implementation does <EM>NOT</EM> support XVideo.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>nVidia</H3>

<P>Some nVidia cards with TV-out can be run using the standard nv driver in 
XFree86, combined with the userspace application <B>nvtv</B> to control the TV-out 
port. See 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/</A> for details.  Recent
versions of the nVidia driver have better support for overscan and other
features useful with TV-Out, so the <B>nvtv</B> application may not be
required.</P>
<P>Some nVidia cards can be run with a proprietary nVidia X driver made
available by nVidia. See 
<A HREF="http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=linux">http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=linux</A> for more information.</P>
<P>Specific cards:
<UL>
<LI>GeForce4 MX440-SE AGP. Has Composite and SVideo ports. Works using the
nVidia X driver.</LI>
<LI>GeForce2 GTS 64 MB DDR 4x AGP. Has SVideo port. Works using the nVidia X 
driver. Reportedly works using the nv driver plus nvtv.</LI>
<LI>GeForce4 MX420 PCI (BFG Asylum). Has SVideo port.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Savage</H3>

<P>The standard savage X driver supports TV out on some Savage cards. 
Unfortunately, XVideo support for the Savage 2000 card (a very common and 
inexpensive Savage card with TV out) is broken. See 
<A HREF="http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html">http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html</A> for details.</P>
<P>Specific cards:
<UL>
<LI>Savage 2000 AGP. Has Composite and SVideo ports. Does not support XVideo.</LI>
<LI>S3 Savage IX 8MB AGP. Has SVideo output. Reported to work.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Other Options</H3>

<P>Some devices with onboard TV-out capability, such as XBoxes converted to 
Linux and some laptops, can be used as MythTV frontends to display on a 
television screen. Please consult the mythtv-users mailing list for messages 
that report the details of these special arrangements.</P>

<H3>External Adapters</H3>

<P>External adapters convert standard VGA output to a form suitable for 
display on a television. The output format varies by region, since 
different countries have different TV standards. People on the mythtv-users 
list have mentioned these adapters:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>AITech Web Cable Plus, powered by external transformer or takes power
from PS/2 keyboard connector, support resolutions up to 1024x768, outputs
composite and SVideo, provides position adjustment.</LI>
<LI>Averkey lite, powered by a USB port, has Composite, SVideo, YPbPr
outputs; pan, brightness, overscan/underscan controls; supports up to
1024x768 outputs; and supports PAL and NTSC.</LI>
<LI>ADS TV Elite XGA</LI>
<LI>AverKey iMicro (comments are generally favorable)</LI>
<LI>AITech Web Cable (comments are generally unfavorable, different than
the "Plus" version above)</LI>
<LI>TVIEW Gold (mentioned once, favorably)</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc3.2">Software.</A>
</H2>

<P>There are a few ways of installing programs on Linux systems; you can
either use a pre-compiled package, or install from a tarball after
satisfying any prerequisites.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: you must have the MySQL database software installed on a
system to store the master database.  This does not necessarily mean that
MySQL must run on one of the MythTV boxes.</P>

<H3>Pre-compiled packages.</H3>

<P>A number of people have created pre-compiled packages for MythTV that may
make your installation easier.</P>
<P><B>BIG FAT WARNING</B>:  This HOWTO assumes that you have <EM>not</EM>
installed MythTV from a package.  All example command lines and file
locations are based on the MythTV tarball defaults.  Some packagers have
modified the filenames, binaries and file locations to match what is
commonly found in that distribution.  Any issues with MythTV installed via a
pre-compiled package <B>MUST</B> be raised with the packager.</P>
<P>If you use any of the pre-compiled packages you may not need to perform any
additional configuration steps in this HOWTO.  The next logical step is 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-6.html#mysql">configuring MySQL</A>, which you may or may not have to
perform.  See your package documentation.</P>

<H3><A NAME="atrpms"></A> Red Hat Linux 9</H3>

<P>Red Hat Linux 9 packages for MythTV and most of its add-on modules and
some themes have been packaged by 
<A HREF="mailto:Axel.Thimm@physik.fu-berlin.de">mailto:Axel.Thimm@physik.fu-berlin.de</A> and are available at 
<A HREF="http://atrpms.physik.fu-berlin.de/topic/multimedia/">http://atrpms.physik.fu-berlin.de/topic/multimedia/</A>. All of the
prerequisites for MythTV (such as XMLTV) are available as RPM packages. If
you have problems with the RPMs, please send him email directly.</P>
<P>Given the large number of dependent RPMs you are advised to use tools like
apt or yum for automatic retrieval and installation of the required RPMs.
(
<A HREF="http://atrpms.physik.fu-berlin.de/install.html">http://atrpms.physik.fu-berlin.de/install.html</A>) In this case a
special meta-package called mythtv-suite will allow you to install all of
MythTV and its add-ons, plus all dependencies.</P>
<P>If you don't have <B>apt</B> or <B>yum</B> on your machine, download and
install the 
<A HREF="http://atrpms.physik.fu-berlin.de/dist/rh9/atrpms-kickstart/">atrpms-kickstart package</A>.
Install the package with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>See <CODE>/usr/share/doc/packagename/README.Debian</CODE> for more information.</P>

<H3>Manual installation</H3>

<P>You may use the graphical tools that come with your distribution, or you
can use command-line utilities.  Either system will get the job done, and it
all depends on your comfort level with Linux.</P>
<P>In order to compile MythTV, we need to make sure that the software it needs
is installed.  As of 2003-03-15, this list includes <B>mysql</B>,
<B>gcc</B>, <B>freetype2-devel</B>, <B>XFree86-devel</B>,
<B>qt-devel</B> and <B>lame</B>.  If you're going to use a remote
control with MythTV, you're going to need the <B>cdialog</B> package in
order to compile <B>lircd</B> if your distribution doesn't have a
pre-packaged <B>lirc</B>.  If you are using <B>XMLTV</B> as a grabber,
you will need <B>perl</B>.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
NOTE:  Qt v3.1 is recommended, but not required.

NOTE:  If you are going to be using RPMs to install various
components, you should be aware that not all packages include the necessary
headers for compiling packages.  If you're having trouble compiling, ensure
that you've installed the -devel version of a prerequisite.

NOTE:  Other than where noted, Mandrake 9.1 users may follow the
Mandrake 9.0 instructions.
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>There appears to be issues with ALSA and simultaneously recording and
playing sound, which is a core requirement for MythTV.  If you are not
running ALSA 0.9.0rc6 or higher and experience lock-ups of your system when
trying to use MythTV, then please check the main ALSA website and upgrade to
the latest version, or see if your distribution has already packaged the
latest ALSA drivers.</P>

<H3><A NAME="graphicinstalltools_"></A> Graphical installation tools. </H3>

<H3>Mandrake 9.0</H3>

<P>On systems running KDE, a tool which will allow you to see what packages
are available and if they're installed on your system can be accessed by
clicking K->Configuration->Packaging->KPackage</P>
<P>While the graphical tools are nice, the command line tool is actually easier
to use.  It's strongly recommended that you use the command line tool.</P>
<P>There are many inter-related modules, so make sure that you've got the
main package for each one, and not a sub package for an unrelated item.  For
example, there are many modules that have "perl" in them; some are a part of
the apache web server, others are a part of the perl distribution.  In each
case, we're looking to make sure that the primary module is getting
installed.</P>
<P>Click the magnifying glass or press <B>CTRL-F</B> and enter "perl" as your
search term.  You should find it under the "Perl" folder.  You need at least
the perl 5.80 base package installed.  If not, click on the "Mark" button.</P>
<P>If you are going to be installing mysql on this system, search for mysql -
it should be under "Databases".  Make sure that mysql and mysql-clients are
installed.  If not, click on "Mark".</P>
<P>Search for gcc.  You're going to need gcc and gcc-c++ installed.</P>
<P>Search for freetype2.  Make sure that you've got freetype2 and
freetype2-devel installed.</P>
<P>Search for XFree86-devel.</P>
<P>Finally, check for qt.  You'll need libqt3-devel (under folder "KDE and
Qt") and libqt3 ("Libraries").</P>
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
NOTE for Mandrake 9.1 users:  Mandrake 9.1 has removed the MySQL modules
from the default installation.  Ensure that you install libqt3-mysql.
</PRE>
<HR>
</P>
<P>Make sure that cdialog is installed if you want to use MythTV with a remote
control if you need to compile <B>lirc</B> from source.</P>
<P>alsa-utils is needed for setting the volume.  MythTV now has native volume
support, but you may have a special configuration that necessitates an
external program to adjust your volume settings.  If this is the case, then

<H3>Red Hat Linux 8.0 </H3>

<P>Red Hat Linux 8.0 does not have the same graphical package manager used
by other distributions, so you will need to use Red Hat's package
manager.  This is the same utility you saw upon installation from the Red
Hat Linux 8.0 installation CD, and it allows you to select packages at
installation time, or once the system is up and running.  You can access
this program by selecting 
<PRE>
RedHatMenu>System Settings>Packages
</PRE>
</P>
<P>If you did a typical Desktop install of Red Hat Linux 8.0 make sure you have
selected:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>KDE Desktop Environment</LI>
<LI>SQL Database Server -  you will have to click on "details" and make 
sure "mysql-server" is checked.  (only required on the master system)</LI>
<LI>Development Tools</LI>
<LI>X Software Development</LI>
<LI>KDE Software Development</LI>
<LI>Kernel Development</LI>
</UL>

<P>Click Install to continue.</P>
<P>You can not install qt-MySQL, a necessary prerequisite, graphically. To

<H3><A NAME="CLIinstalltools_"></A> Command-line installation. </H3>

<P> This section details the various methods for installing prerequisites
from the command line.</P>

<H3>Mandrake</H3>

<P><B>urpmi</B> is the simplest tool for installation of packages from the
command line, but properly configuring it can be difficult.  The
following website 
<A HREF="http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php">http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php</A> will allow you to choose
a mirror site and then present the command-line configuration text for that
mirror.  You will most likely need to add a "Contrib" mirror to your setup. 
If you add a site from the "Penguin Liberation Front", you will be able to
load the <CODE>lame</CODE> library without compiling from source.</P>

<H3>Special instructions for Mandrake 8.2 </H3>

<P>Mandrake 8.2 does not have a pre-packaged libqt3-devel, so you must compile
and install this manually.  The following command will install the
prerequisites for qt3, so don't skip this step.  The simplest tool for
installing packages from the command line is urpmi.</P>
<P>Open a shell, and execute the following.  You may get asked a number of
questions regarding dependencies.  It's best to answer "YES".</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ urpmi mesa-common-devel libmng1-devel mysql-devel libunixodbc2-devel
$ urpmi postgresql-devel xfree86-static-libs
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Once all of the prerequisites have been installed, the next step is to
obtain and compile the source RPM.</P>
<P>Go to 
<A HREF="http://www.rpmfind.net">http://www.rpmfind.net</A> and search for
<CODE>qt3</CODE>.  There will be a number of different versions available.  As
of 2002-12-02, the latest version for Mandrake is called
<CODE>qt3-3.0.5-7mdk.src.rpm</CODE>. Unless you are running <B>Mandrake
Cooker</B> (the beta version of the next release of Mandrake), make sure to
download the standard "Mandrake" release.  Download the <CODE>.src.rpm</CODE>
file to a directory that you can find.  
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# cp qt3-3.0.5-7mdk.src.rpm /usr/src/RPMS/SRPMS
# cd /usr/src/RPMS/SRPMS
# rpm --rebuild qt3-3.0.5-7mdk.src.rpm
# cd ../RPMS
# ls -l
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The "ls -l" command will show you a directory listing.  There should be two
files, one will be named "qt3" and the other will be "qt3-devel".  The full
filenames will vary, so one you know the filename, you can install them with
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# rpm -Uvh [filename1]
# rpm -Uvh [filename2]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Once this has completed (it can take a while, so please be patient),
continue by following the Mandrake 9.0 instructions.</P>

<H3>Mandrake 8.2 and 9.0</H3>

<P>The simplest tool for installing packages from the command line is
<B>urpmi</B>.</P>
<P>Open a shell, and execute the following, all on the same line. You may get
asked a number of questions regarding dependencies.  It's best to answer
"YES".
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

# urpmi mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel cdialog alsa-utils

<P>In that case, you're ready to move to the next 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-4.html#Setting_up_paths">section</A>.</P>
<H3>Red Hat Linux 8.0</H3>

<P>[Please submit instructions]</P>

<H3>Gentoo. </H3>

<P>If Qt has not been installed on your system: Edit
<CODE>/etc/make.conf</CODE> and locate the "USE" variable. If the line is
commented out, remove the comment. The line should have at least:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
USE="mysql qt alsa"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Next you need to build Qt. If you don't plan on using the ebuilds as 
described in the Gentoo section then you also need to install lame.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ emerge qt lame mysql
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you have already installed Qt: you will need to rebuild because the
default installation doesn't include mysql support, a requirement for MythTV.  
To enable SQL support, add "mysql qt" to your USE variable in 
<CODE>/etc/make.conf</CODE> and rebuild Qt by running
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ emerge qt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Install MySQL if this is the master system:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ emerge mysql
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>All the necessary files will be downloaded and built. Even on a fast machine
this may take a lot of time if you need to do a full Qt build.</P>
