</H2>

<P>mythtv is a software video encoder, which means that it uses a fairly
generic "dumb" video capture card to get frames of video, encodes them using
the CPU on your motherboard and writes them to disk.  High-end video capture
cards and devices like the Tivo and RePlay have dedicated encoder chips
which use specialized hardware to convert the video stream to the MPEG-2
format without using the motherboard CPU.  The main CPU has the
responsibility of running the Operating System and reading and writing the
encoded frames to the disk.  These tasks have fairly low CPU requirements
compared to encoding video, which is why a device like a Series 1 Tivo can
run with only 16MB of RAM and a 54Mhz CPU.</P>
<P>Currently, there are no known MPEG-2 encoder cards that have video4linux
drivers which would be suitable for use with mythtv.  Once the drivers are
written, support for hardware MPEG-2 encoders can be integrated.</P>
<P>There are many variables that go into the question: "How fast a CPU do I
need to run mythtv"?  Obviously, the faster your CPU, the better your
experience will be with mythtv.  Performing the "Watch TV" function, where
the CPU is both encoding and decoding video simultaneously to allow Pause,
Fast Forward and Rewind functions for live TV requires twice as much CPU as
just encoding or decoding.  mythtv also supports multiple encoder cards in a
single PC, increasing the CPU requirements if you are going to
simultaneously encode multiple programs.</P>
<P>Here are a few data points:
<UL>
<LI>A PIII/733Mhz system can encode one video stream using the RTJPEG
codec using 512x480 capture resolution.  This does not allow for live TV
watching, but does allow for encoding video and then watching it later.</LI>
<LI>The developer states that his AMD1800+ system can <B>almost</B>
encode two MPEG4 video streams and watch one program simultaneously.</LI>
<LI>A PIII/800Mhz system with 512MB RAM can encode one video
stream using the RTJPEG codec with 480x480 capture resolution and play it back
simultaneously, thereby allowing live TV watching.</LI>
<LI>A dual Celeron/450Mhz is able to view a 480x480 MPEG4/3300Kbps file
created on a different system with 30% CPU usage.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc3.2">Software.</A>
</H2>

<P>There are a few ways of installing programs on Linux systems; you can either
use the graphical tools that come with your distribution, or you can use
command-line utilities.  Either system will get the job done, and it all
depends on your comfort level with Linux.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: If you are using mythtv on multiple systems, at least one of
them will maintain the master database and will need mysql installed.  </P>
<P>In order to compile mythtv, we need to make sure that the software it needs
is installed.  As of 2002-12-02, this list includes <B>perl</B>,
<B>mysql</B> (only on the master system; remote viewers do not need mysql
installed and will use the master database), <B>gcc</B>, <B>freetype2-devel</B> and
<B>qt-devel</B>.  If you're going to use a remote control with mythtv,
you're going to need the <B>cdialog</B> package in order to compile
<B>lircd</B>.</P>
<P>There appears to be issues with ALSA and simultaneously recording and playing 
sound, which is a core requirement for mythtv.  If you are not running 
ALSA 0.9.0rc6 and experience lock-ups of your system when trying to use mythtv, 
then please check the main ALSA website and upgrade to the latest version,
or see if your distribution has already packaged the latest ALSA drivers.</P>

<H3><A NAME="graphicinstalltools_"></A> Graphical installation tools. </H3>

<H3>Mandrake 9.0</H3>

<P>On systems running KDE, a tool which will allow you to see what packages
are available and if they're installed on your system can be accessed by
clicking K->Configuration->Packaging->KPackage</P>
<P>There are many inter-related modules, so make sure that you've got the
main package for each one, and not a sub package for an unrelated item.  For
example, there are many modules that have "perl" in them; some are a part of
the apache web server, others are a part of the perl distribution.  In each
case, we're looking to make sure that the primary module is getting
installed.</P>
<P>Click the magnifying glass or press <B>CTRL-F</B> and enter "perl" as your
search term.  You should find it under the "Perl" folder.  You need at least
the perl 5.80 base package installed.  If not, click on the "Mark" button.</P>
<P>If you are going to be installing mysql on this system, search for mysql -
it should be under "Databases".  Make sure that mysql and mysql-clients are
installed.  If not, click on "Mark".</P>
<P>Search for gcc.  You're going to need gcc and gcc-c++ installed.</P>
<P>Search for freetype2.  Make sure that you've got freetype2 and
freetype2-devel installed.</P>
<P>Finally, check for qt.  You'll need libqt3-devel (under folder "KDE and
Qt") and libqt3 ("Libraries").</P>
<P>Make sure that cdialog is installed if you want to use mythtv with a remote
control.</P>
<P>alsa-utils is needed for setting the volume.</P>
<P>If you marked anything to install, click on Install Marked.  Click "Yes" or
OK if you get a message about satisfying dependencies.</P>

<H3>Red Hat Linux 8.0 </H3>

<P>Red Hat Linux 8.0 does not have the same graphical package manager used
by other distributions, so you will need to use Red Hat's package
manager.  This is the same utility you saw upon installation from the Red
Hat Linux 8.0 installation CD, and it allows you to select packages at
installation time, or once the system is up and running.  You can access
this program by selecting 
<PRE>
RedHatMenu>System Settings>Packages
</PRE>
</P>
<P>If you did a typical Desktop install of Red Hat Linux 8.0 make sure you have
selected:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>KDE Desktop Environment</LI>
<LI>SQL Database Server -  you will have to click on "details" and make 
sure "mysql-server" is checked.  (only required on the master system)</LI>
<LI>Development Tools</LI>
<LI>X Software Development</LI>
<LI>KDE Software Development</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Click Install to continue.</P>
<P>The version of QT supplied with Red Hat Linux 8.0 does not include a
necessary mysql plugin. You will have to download and install that RPM
package yourself. First go to 
<A HREF="http://rpm.pbone.net/">http://rpm.pbone.net/</A> and click on "Search" near the top of the
page. On the search page unselect all checkboxes except "RedHat 8.X". Next
select the "Search for RPMs by name in FTP........." radio button. In the
search field enter "qt-MySQL" then click "Search".  You will be presented
with a list of mirrors who host this particular RPM, currently called 
"qt-MySQL-3.0.5-17.i386.rpm". Download the RPM.  I had good luck downloading
from the ftp.pbone.net mirror. Once downloaded, double click on the RPM
package. You will be prompted for the root password, enter it, watch the
progress bar, and you are finished.</P>

<H3><A NAME="CLIinstalltools_"></A> Command-line installation. </H3>

<P> This section details the various methods for installing pre-requisites
from the command line.</P>

<H3>Mandrake</H3>

<H3>Special instructions for Mandrake 8.2</H3>

<P>Mandrake 8.2 does not have a pre-packaged libqt3-devel, so you must compile and
install this manually.  The following command will install the
pre-requisites for qt3, so don't skip this step.  
The simplest tool for installing packages from the command line is
<B>urpmi</B>.</P>
<P>Open a shell, and execute the following.  You may get asked a number of
questions regarding dependencies.  It's best to answer "YES".</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ urpmi mesa-common-devel libmng1-devel mysql-devel libunixodbc2-devel
$ urpmi postgresql-devel xfree86-static-libs
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Once all of the pre-requisites have been installed, the next step is to
obtain and compile the source RPM.</P>
<P>Go to 
<A HREF="http://www.rpmfind.net">http://www.rpmfind.net</A> and search for
<CODE>qt3</CODE>.  There will be a number of different versions available.  As
of 2002-12-02, the latest version for Mandrake is called
<CODE>qt3-3.0.5-7mdk.src.rpm</CODE>. Unless you are running <B>Mandrake
Cooker</B> (the beta version of the next release of Mandrake), make sure to
download the standard "Mandrake" release.  Download the <CODE>.src.rpm</CODE>
file to a directory that you can find.  
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# cp qt3-3.0.5-7mdk.src.rpm /usr/src/RPMS/SRPMS
# cd /usr/src/RPMS/SRPMS
# rpm --rebuild qt3-3.0.5-7mdk.src.rpm
# cd ../RPMS
# ls -l
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The "ls -l" command will show you a directory listing.  There should be two
files, one will be named "qt3" and the other will be "qt3-devel".  The full
filenames will vary, so one you know the filename, you can install them with
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# rpm -Uvh [filename1]
# rpm -Uvh [filename2]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Once this has completed (it can take a while, so please be patient),
continue by following the Mandrake 9.0 instructions.</P>

<H3>Mandrake 8.2 and 9.0</H3>

<P>The simplest tool for installing packages from the command line is
<B>urpmi</B>.</P>
<P>Open a shell, and execute the following, all on the same line. You may get
asked a number of questions regarding dependencies.  It's best to answer
"YES".</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# urpmi perl gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel cdialog alsa-utils
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If this is the master system maintaining the database, you will need to install mysql:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# urpmi mysql
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: Mandrake 8.2 users, <EM>do not</EM> execute the following
command.  You've already manually installed the files in the previous
section.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# urpmi libqt3-devel
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>However, you might get this when you execute the command above:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[root@pvr root]# urpmi perl mysql gcc gcc-c++ freetype2-devel libqt3-devel cdialog alsa-utils
everything already installed
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In that case, you're ready to move to the next 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-4.html#Setting_up_paths">section</A>.</P>
<H3>Red Hat Linux 8.0</H3>

<P>[Please submit instructions]</P>

<H3>Gentoo. </H3>

<P>If KDE has not been installed on your system: Edit
<CODE>/etc/make.conf</CODE> and locate the "USE" variable. If the line is
commented out, remove the comment. The line should have at least:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
USE="mysql qt alsa"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Next you need to build KDE. If you don't plan on using the ebuilds as 
described in the Gentoo section then you also need to install lame.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ emerge kde lame mysql
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If KDE has already been installed, by default, QT libraries with SQL support 
are not built. To enable SQL support, add "mysql qt" to your USE variable in 
<CODE>/etc/make.conf</CODE> and rebuild QT by running
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ emerge qt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Install MySQL if this is the master system:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ emerge mysql
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>All the necessary files will be downloaded and built. This will take a lot
of time, even on a fast machine if you have to do a full KDE build.</P>
