<P>The MythTV master backend is responsible for managing the schedule
for all TV tuner cards on the master and any slave. Its job is to
search the TV listing for the shows you have requested and assign
recordings to the TV tuner cards. If none of the shows that you've
chosen overlap, it simply records all of the shows. However, if
there are shows where the beginning and end times overlap, the
scheduler follows rules that you've specified or makes logical
decisions about what would be best if you haven't express your
preference. Further, the "Upcoming Recordings" page allows you make
specific decisions about what you really do and don't want to
record.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss12.1">12.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc12.1">Record Types</A>
</H2>

<P>When you choose a show that you would like to record from the
Options Page, there are eight different types of rules to help the
scheduler find which showings you would like to record.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Single Record -- record only this title at this specific
time. This is the best way to be sure that a certain showing is
recorded. However, if the TV listings change and the show is not
broadcast at that time, the show will not be recorded.
</LI>
<LI>Find One -- this will record a title once from any of the times
that appear in the TV listings. This is useful for recording a movie
or special that has multiple showings because it allows the scheduler
to choose one that doesn't conflict. It is not a good choice for
recording a single episode of a series because it records the first
available showing of the title without regard to the episode
information.
</LI>
<LI>Record Weekly -- this records a show whenever the title is listed
on the same channel, weekday and time. Note that if the TV station
changes the schedule for a special episode, it would not be
recorded. However, you can add a Single record for the special
episode.
</LI>
<LI>Find Weekly -- this will record a title once per week from any
of the times that appear in the TV listings beginning from the time of
the showing that was selected when the rule was set. This is useful
for news, current events or other programs where the same episode is
shown several times each week but the listings may not include
descriptive information. This is not a good choice if there are
different episodes shown during the week.
</LI>
<LI>Record Daily -- this records a show whenever the title is listed
for the time and channel on any day of the week. Here again, a show
will not be recorded if the time was altered by the station.
</LI>
<LI>Find Daily -- this will record a title once per day from any
of the times that appear in the TV listings beginning from the time of
the showing that was selected when the rule was set. This is useful
for news, current events or other programs where the same episode is
shown several times each day but the listings may not include
descriptive information. This is not a good choice if there are
different episodes shown during the day.
</LI>
<LI>Channel Record -- records a show anytime the title is listed on
this channel.  This is perhaps the most common rule to use for most
shows.
</LI>
<LI>Record All -- record this title on any channel at any time. This
can be useful if a station has sister stations where shows are
rebroadcast allowing the scheduler to record rebroadcasts on the other
station when the original airing cannot be recorded.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss12.2">12.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc12.2">Scheduling Options</A>
</H2>

<H3>Priority</H3>

<P>By default, all shows you select have equal value to the
scheduler.  There are a set of rules to make good choices when
two or more shows are in conflict. However, priority values let the
scheduler know what you want so that it can set the schedule based
on your preferences.</P>
<P>Initially all priority values are set to zero. You may choose to
leave everything at "0" and let the scheduler follow rules to guess
what you might prefer when there are conflicts. However, if you have
one or two favorite shows, you may want to increase the priority
value so the scheduler will know that you would prefer recording
these over other shows. You might use certain values to rate shows
so that all favorites are 2. good shows are 1 and extra 'filler'
shows are all -1 for example. You could sort each title on the "Set
Priorities" to have a unique value so the scheduler can always know
which show you'd prefer verses any other show. The choice and style
are entirely up to you. However, the more information you give to
the scheduler, the more likely it will make the choices you would
like in the first place.</P>
<P>The scheduler choices are based on the total priority for a showing
by adding up four different priority factors. By default, all of
these factors are "0" but you may use any combination to express
your likes and needs.</P>
<P>Per record rule -- this is the "priority" field in the "Scheduling
Options" section of the options page and this values is included for
any showings that match the recording rule.  You may choose to only
use these values and not use the other factors for the sake of
simplicity and clarity.</P>
<P>Per record type -- Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->General
allows you to add to the priority based on the type. It may make
sense to increase the value for "Single" so that by default they
have an extra advantage over other shows. You may want to decrease
the value for Find rules so that they will be less likely to interfere
with regular shows and will be more likely to record in a
non-conflicting time instead.</P>
<P>Per channel -- Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->Channel
Priorities can be useful if you believe that you prefer any of the
shows on certain channels. This would give all shows on a channel an
advantage by default.</P>
<P>Input preference -- in the MythTV "setup" program, the "Input
Connections" section allows you to add additional priority in the
"Input preference". This is simply another priority factor but has an
interesting effect. If a card input has a higher value than the other
cards, the scheduler will see that you would rather record showings of
episodes on this card rather than a showing on another card. If you
have multiple cards of different quality, you may want to set input
preference to encourage the scheduler to record shows on your best
card(s) whenever possible. This can also be useful if you have
multiple video sources which include the same stations. For example,
with digital and analog cable you could increase the digital cable
input preference by 1 to tell the scheduler that you want to record
from the digital station whenever possible but the station on the
analog input could still be used when the digital input is busy.</P>
<P>For any single showing of any show you've chosen to record, these
factors are added together to find the "total priority". This is the
priority that the scheduler uses to decide which shows are given the
first choice when filling in the schedule.</P>
<P>The scheduling priority of a show may also be used to determine
auto-expiration of recordings when disk space gets full (see 
<A HREF="#Auto-Expire">Auto-Expire</A>, below).</P>

<H3>Duplicates</H3>

<P>Singles will record without regard to duplicate matching.</P>

<P>The standard recurring methods of All, Channel, Weekly and Daily use
the descriptive information in the TV listings to try to record only one
showing of each unique episode. However, This goal is sometimes
complicated by the fact that the stations may not include a description
for a specific episode but use a generic description for the series
instead. When there is a generic description, the default behavior is to
assume that it may be an episode that you have not seen and to record it
for you.  One of the duplicate matching options is "Record new episodes
only".  If this is selected, listing that have an original air date of
more than 14 days earlier are considered repeats and are not eligible to
record. Generally, generic episodes will be marked as repeats also.</P>

<P>Because of generic episodes and other situations, MythTV offers an
alternative approach where shows may be recorded by choosing from
multiple showings even when the descriptive information is not reliable.
All of the "Find" record types look for matching titles in the
listings. If there is a showing with specific episode information and
that episode has recorded before, that showing is marked as previously
or currently recorded. The scheduler will then choose to record the
earliest non-conflicting showing from any of other remaining showings
regardless of the descriptive information. Generally, Find One is most
useful for movies or specials and the Find Daily and Find Weekly rules
are best for news or current events shows that are repeated. However,
these may be useful in other situations where the standard recording
rules may not work correctly.</P>

<H3>Conflicts</H3>

<P>As you add more shows that you would like to record, the scheduler
will eventually encounter conflicts. If there are two shows at the
same time and you have two or more TV tuner cards, both shows will
record. However, if there are more shows than cards, the scheduler
will have to decide what it thinks it should not record based on the
information you have given. If you see an unexpected situation you
are not "stuck" with the scheduler's choice. You can still tell the
scheduler exactly which shows you do want to record and/or don't
want to record in any situation.</P>

<H3>Scheduling decisions</H3>

<P>Here are the actual decisions made by the scheduler as it fills in the
schedule.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Currently recording beats not currently recording -- A recording in
progress can not be moved so it "wins" it's current timeslot.
</LI>
<LI>Higher total priority beats lower total priority -- This is the core of
the scheduling process. Episodes of the highest priority show are placed
on the first available card then the next highest priority and so on.
</LI>
<LI>Future start time beats passed start time -- If there is an
episode in progress and also a later showing of the same episode, it
is better to record the complete episode. If there isn't another
showing, start recording now to record the remaining portion.
This should only happen if you add a new rule while the show is in
progress or if the master backend is started after the start time of
a scheduled show.
</LI>
<LI>More specific record type beats less specific record type -- If
two shows are on at the same time and have the same total priority but
different types they will be sorted by Single then Find One, Record
Weekly, Find Weekly, Record Daily, Find Daily, Channel and finally
All. This only applies if the priorities are the same.
</LI>
<LI>If both start times have passed, later start time beats earlier start
time -- This attempts to miss the least amount of time.
</LI>
<LI>If neither start time has passed, earlier start time beats later start
time -- This rule help assure that the earliest showing of an episode has
the advantage.
</LI>
<LI>Lower input id beats higher input id -- The scheduler fills in open
time slots on the first available card. The next cards is used when there is
another show already placed for the first card.
</LI>
<LI>Older record rule beats newer record rule -- If two shows are still
equal after all of these other checks, the show whose record rule was added
first is preferred over a more recent addition.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Reschedule Higher Priorities</H3>

<P>Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->General has a checkbox for
"Reschedule Higher Priorities" which tells the scheduler to try to be a
little smarter in certain situations. If this is checked, the scheduler will
look for situations where a show cannot record because all inputs for the
channel are used for higher priority shows. It will check to see if any of
the other shows could be recorded at another time so that the conflicting
show can be recorded in it's place.</P>
<P>Generally, this is a good strategy but there are tradeoffs. If a higher
priority show is postponed, you will not get to watch it until it is
recorded in the later timeslot. There is also a risk that the TV listings
may change and the later showing may go away. In this rare case the higher
priority show may never record. On the other hand, if you do not use this
option you will miss recording some lower priority shows unnecessarily
unless you make similar these changes manually.</P>
<P>By using Reschedule Higher Priorities, the scheduler will do a better job of
recording as many of your shows as possible when left unattended. It will
also be easy to see that shows have been marked to record at a later time.
You can then decide for yourself when you would prefer to record the first
showing.</P>

<H3>Controlling Your Schedule</H3>

<P>The Manage Recordings->Upcoming Recordings page is your control center
for the MythTV scheduler. Unlike other DVR systems, this one page gives you
all of the information and tools you need to see all of your alternatives
and make whatever adjustments you desire.</P>
<P>The upper half of the screen has a scrollable box listing items that match
your record rules sorted by time. The lower half shows the details for the
highlighted item. There are two 'views' available. Press "1" to include all
of the items that match record rules even if they do not need to be
recorded. Press "2" to focus on just the things that will record and items
that may need your attention. The message in the upper right-hand corner
will remind you when there are conflicts that would prevent one or more
shows from being recorded.</P>
<P>The items in the list are colored white for things that will record,
gray for those that do not need to record and yellow when there is a
time conflict. Items at the top of the list may also be highlighted
indicating that the recording is in progress.</P>
<P>Along with the channels, start times and titles, the right-hand column has a
status code. Numbers indicate which card number has been assigned to record
the show. Letters are used to indicate the reason that something will not be
recorded. Just below the box is a short status message for the highlighted
item that indicates the type of record rule that was matched and a one or
two word explanation of the status code. If you press SELECT, you will see
more information about the status.</P>
<P>There are a few status codes that may require your attention. "C" indicates
that there are more overlapping shows to record than there are TV tuners to
record them. "L" indicates that the scheduler found that it may be better to
record a later showing of this episode. These states happen as a result of
your choices and should normally reflect your preferences. However, you may
notice situations where you would like to modify the scheduler's initial
choices.</P>
<P>The first thing you can do is to highlight an item and press INFO once or
twice to see the Recording Options page. From this page you can change the
record rule type, the duplicate matching rules, or raise or lower the
priority to resolve whatever problem you noticed.</P>
<P>Additionally, you can treat any individual showing as an exception that you
do want to record or don't want to record. To use these "override" features,
highlight the item and press SELECT. You will see a message explaining the
current status and at least an "OK" button to exit without making changes.</P>
<P>For items scheduled to record, there will be a button for "Don't record"
which will prevent recording this showing but will still allow the same
episode to record in the future. If there is episode description
information, you may also see a button for "Never record".  This prevents
recording this showing and tells MythTV to remember that this is an episode
that you've seen or don't need to see if it is ever in the TV listings
again.</P>
<P>For items that are not scheduled to record, the message will describe the
reason and in the case of "C" or "L" it will include a list of the shows
that are scheduled to record instead. For any item that could potentially be
recorded there will be buttons for "Edit Options" and "Add Override". "Edit
Options" will allow you to change the options for the existing record rule
such as raising the priority so that the show will record. These changes
would apply to this and all future showings that match this record rule.
"Add Override" will allow you to set options that apply to the specific
showing without affecting the existing record rule.</P>
<P>If you return to an override page after an override has already been set,
you will also see a "Clear override" to undo your changes. This option makes
it very easy to try out some "what if" attempts when deciding on your best
strategy in a difficult situation.</P>

</H2>

<H3>Recording Profile</H3>

<P>Each schedule can be configured with a different recording profile.
For example, important shows can be configured with a "High Quality"
profile, while "filler" shows can be configured with a "Low Quality"
profile. These recording profiles need to be configured first (see
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-10.html#Recording">Recording</A>, above).</P>

<H3><A NAME="Recording Group"></A> Recording Group </H3>

<P>For organization of the "Watch Recordings" screen and the MythWeb
interface, recordings can be grouped into "recording groups".</P>

<H3>Time Stretch</H3>

<P>A default time stretch value can be configured for each schedule;
this value will automatically be applied when the recordings are
played back.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Auto-Expire"></A> Auto-Expire </H3>

<P>MythTV will "autoexpire" old recordings to make room for new recordings
when disk space gets filled up. This option can be set to "Don't allow
auto expire" to prevent recordings from being automatically deleted
when disk space fills up.</P>

<P>The default setting is for all scheduled recordings to be eligible
for auto-expiration; this can be changed in the Settings->TV
Settings->General page by manipulating the "Auto Expire Default"
checkbox.</P>

<P>The default auto-expire policy is "Oldest Show First"; the oldest
recordings are deleted first. The "Lowest Priority First" method
chooses to expire the lowest-priority recordings first.</P>

<H3>Episode Limit</H3>

<P>An episode limit can also be configured to limit the maximum number
of episodes recorded of a single series, to restrict that series' disk
usage. If this is set, you can further decide what to do when this
limit is reached: either stop recording that series, or to delete the
oldest episodes in favor of the new ones.</P>

<H3>Commercial Flagging</H3>

<P>Select whether or not to automatically flag commercials for these
recordings. Commercial Flagging parameters can be set in
Setup->TV Settings->General.</P>

<H3>Transcoding</H3>

<P>Select whether or not to automatically transcode recordings to save
disk space. Before using this, you must first enable auto-transcode in
the recording profile and configure the transcoding parameters; see
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-10.html#Recording">Recording</A>, above.</P>

<H3>User Jobs</H3>

<P>User Jobs allow you to configure up to 4 custom commands to run on
recordings. They can be configured in mythtv-setup. The following
tokens have special meaning when used in the User Job commands:</P>

</H2>

<P>Creating Power Search rules with Custom Record</P>
<P>MythTV's "Custom Record" feature gives you unlimited control for creating
specialized search recording rules to meet your needs. It allows you to
choose your criteria to search for matching shows based on any of the
information in the program listings, channel information, time functions and
more. This goes beyond the capabilities of any other DVR system and it is
unlikely that this level of scheduling customization will ever be available
in any commercial DVR system.</P>

<H3>Getting Started</H3>

<P>Go to Schedule Recordings->Custom Record. This page, titled "Power Search
Recording Rule Editor", helps you build a database search one clause at a
time. Each added clause further limits which showings will be matched in the
TV listings data. You can test the search at any time and when you are done,
you can save your search as a recording rule.</P>
<P>To familiarize yourself with how you can create custom rules, create a
simple rule to record "Nova" only in primetime.</P>
<P>The first item at the top of the page allows you to edit an existing rule or
create a new rule. Leave it on "&lt;New rule&gt;". Arrow down to the third item
which says "Match an exact title". Right and left arrows would allow you to
select any of several prefabricated pieces or full examples but leave it on
the default for now. Arrow down to "Add this example clause" and press
SELECT (Enter or Space on a keyboard). The large text box should now show:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     program.title = "Nova"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

As you have probably guessed, this says that we want to search for all
programs with the title "Nova" regardless of the time, day, channel, etc.</P>
<P>If you do not receive a PBS station that carries "Nova" or would like to
use another title, edit the title by pressing the down arrow to highlight
the text box and right arrow over the the word "Nova". If you are using a
keyboard you can simply delete the four letters and type a different title
between the quotes. With a remote control, you can do 'cell phone' style
text entry with the number pad. The delete key is the "X" in the grouping
for "1", zero is grouped with "9" and "0" acts as the "Caps Lock" key.</P>
<P>Note: the text box honors many familiar Emacs control keys. It is also
possible to cut and paste text into the text box so you can edit with a
favorite editor or insert a rule sent in email or from other sources.</P>
<P>In any case, choose a title that is shown both in primetime and late night
or daytime. Next, click the "Test" button. You should see a list of the
upcoming episodes for "Nova" just as if you had clicked the Upcoming
button for "Nova" elsewhere in MythTV.</P>
<P>Press ESC to go back to the Custom Record page. Move to the example
selector then press the right or left arrows until you find "Only in
primetime". Click "Add this example clause". You should now see:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
            program.title = "Nova"
            AND HOUR(program.starttime) >= 19
            AND HOUR(program.starttime) &lt; 23
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Click "Test". You should now see a shorter list with only the showings that
begin between 7PM and 11PM. To create a rule for this, press ESC to go back
to the custom page and move to "Rule Name:" then type "Nova" or anything
else you would like. This is only a label and will not affect the search
results. Once a name has been entered, the "Record" button will light up.
Click this to enter the recording options page. If you named it "Nova" the
title will say "Nova (Power Search)". Set whatever options you would like
then click "Save these settings". You now have a special rule to record
"Nova" but only when it is shown in primetime.</P>
<P>To remove this, or any other rule, you can go to the "Recording Priorities"
page, arrow down to the title, press Enter and change the the recording type
to "Do not record this program" then "Save these settings".</P>

<H3>How it Works</H3>

<P>MythTV stores TV program information in a database and uses the Structured
Query Language (SQL) to access the data. Information about each TV program
is stored in the 'program' table and information about each TV station you
receive is stored in 'channel'. These two tables are used in the scheduler
queries and their fields are available to be used in your rules. The rules
you create are stored in 'record'. Normal rules in MythTV simply match the
title in the rule with the titles in the 'program' table.</P>
<P>MythTV also has search rules for "Titles", "Keywords" and "People". These
store the key phrase in the description field of the rule and includes them
in specialized SQL replacements for the normal title check. There is also a
type called "Power Search" which takes the raw SQL in the description as the
replacement for title matching.</P>
<P>Custom Record is a tool to help you build valid SQL for Power Search rules.
You do not need to be a SQL expert to use Custom Record because the
examples are known to work correctly and are usually self-explanatory so you
can choose the pieces you need then modify them.  Many powerful solutions to
unique problems are possible by combining the examples. With some creativity
and some knowledge of SQL, the possibilities are limitless.</P>

<H3>Common Tricks and Tips</H3>

<P>The example clauses marked "complete example" are actual rules that have
been used to address specific problems. You may find that some of these
are useful for you as-is or with slight modifications. These show off how
powerful custom rules can be but there are also several simple idioms that
you may find useful for many of the shows you would like to record.</P>
<P>Wait for a known title -- If there is a movie that you anticipate will be
televised in the coming months but is not yet in the listings, you can
select "Match an exact title", edit the movie title, click "Record" then
choose "Record one showing of this title". The rule will wait weeks, months
or years until this title shows up in your listings then it will record one
showing. These rules have no impact on the scheduler throughout the day and
only take a tiny fraction of a second when the master backend starts or when
the listings are updated.</P>
<P>Silence series out of season -- "Celebrity Poker Showdown", for example,
will have new episodes for a while then long periods where reruns are shown
dozens of times per week. By checking the previously shown flag you can
create a rule that will only match new episodes.  Therefore, your schedule
won't be polluted with dozens of entries marked as "Repeat" or "Previously
Recorded".
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       program.title = "Celebrity Poker Showdown"
       AND program.previouslyshown = 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This allows you to keep rules for your favorite shows that are dormant while
out of season but will spring back to life when new episodes appear.</P>
<P>Choose showings on certain days -- Several cable stations will show their
highest rated shows a dozen on more times per week. However, the scheduler
only needs two or three choices to do a good job of making a flexible
choice.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       program.title LIKE "Celebrity Fit Club%"
       AND DAYNAME(program.starttime) = "Sunday"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This says to choose any showing of an episode that hasn't been recorded
when it appears on Sunday. This prevents all the other showings during the
week from being listed in the schedule.</P>
<P>Notice the word "LIKE" and the "%" at the end. This does wildcard matching
so that this would match even if the title ended with "2".  "III" or
":Revenge of the Snapple Lady". This can be useful where the title may
change from one season to the next like "Survivor%", "Big Brother%" or
"The Amazing Race%".</P>

<H3>Working with SQL</H3>

<P>As you experiment, it is possible that you may misplace a quote or mistype a
word. If there is a mistake when you press "Test" or "Record" you will see
an error message returned from the database. This will usually give you a
good idea about what needs to be fixed. However, for more subtle MySQL
syntax errors, you can find more information in the documentation at 
<A HREF="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/</A>. This contains a lot of
information that can be useful for Power Search rules such as the "Date and
Time Functions". There are many other good resources for SQL on the Web.</P>
<P>While the example clauses demonstrate how many of the data fields may be
used, you can get a more complete list of all the fields that are available
by using a MySQL client program:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg
mysql> describe program;
mysql> describe channel;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This will show the names of all of the fields along with their type and
default value. Most are easy to understand but a few need some explanation
in order to use them effectively with Power Search.

<LI>"program.category_type" holds one of these exact four strings: "movie",
"series", "sports" or "tvshow".
</LI>
<LI>"program.airdate" is a string representing the year of release for movies
and may have no meaning for other types of shows.
</LI>
<LI>"program.stars" is a floating point number from 0.0 to 1.0. On a four star
scale, 1.0 would be four stars, 0.75 would be three stars and so on.
</LI>
<LI>"program.originalairdate" if provided is the date when a show
was, or will be, first televised. This may be useful for finding
episodes before or after a certain date such as finding just the
original series of "Battlestar Galactica".
</LI>
<LI>"program.previouslyshown" is a field created by MythTV to try to
determine if a showing is more than 14 days after its original air date or
if the show was marked as a repeat and did not have a date for the first
airing. If this is "0" it usually means that this is a brand new show or a
rebroadcast within the first two weeks.
</LI>
<LI>"program.programid" is the Tribune Media Service database record identifier
for each program description. In general, these start with a two letter
prefix, MV, EP, SP or SH that correspond to the "program.category_type". 
For most, the last four digits are "0000" except EP where the last four
digits are the episode number in the series. Note that these are generated
by TMS and not the show's producers but they are usually in the same order as
the original air dates for the episodes. Detailed information can be found
in the Data Direct documentation at

Finally, if you are doing something very experimental and a field is not
giving you the results you had anticipated, you can always check the MythTV
source code to see exactly how a field is used. The open source for MythTV
