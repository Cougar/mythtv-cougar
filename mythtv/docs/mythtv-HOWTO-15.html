<H2><A NAME="ss15.1">15.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc15.1">Illegal Instruction.</A>
</H2>

<P>This error can happen for the following reasons:
<UL>
<LI>You have an AMD K6-2 or VIA C3 processor.  If you have either of
these, make sure that you you followed the instructions in this 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-5.html#nonintelcpu_">section</A>.</LI>
<LI>You have an early production Intel Celeron, Pentium Pro or Pentium II.  If you have any
of these processors, make sure that your 
<A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO-9.html#deinterlace_">deinterlace</A>
variable is set correctly.  Your CPU needs to support SSE instructions for
deinterlace support.  You may check this by doing a <CODE>$ cat
/proc/cpuinfo</CODE> and looking for "sse" in the processor flags section.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.2">15.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc15.2">mythfilldatabase failing.</A>
</H2>

<P>If mythtvfilldatabase suddenly appears to be failing, check to see what version of
XMLTV you're running.  Versions prior to 0.5.4 need to have the following
change made: edit the
<CODE>/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/XMLTV/ZapListings.pm</CODE> file and
perform a global search and replace, searching for "tvlistings2" and
replacing it with "tvlistings".</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.3">15.3</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc15.3">mythtv seems to disappear; can't see video</A>
</H2>

<P>If you're using Gnome as your window manager, try switching to KDE.  For
Red Hat Linux 8.0 users, edit <CODE>/etc/sysconfig/desktop</CODE> and
change "GNOME" to "KDE".</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.4">15.4</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc15.4">Fast CPU, choppy or jittery video.</A>
</H2>

<P>This is most likely because your hard drive isn't setup to use DMA.  Use
the <B>hdparm</B> program to check and enable DMA.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# hdparm -d /dev/hd?
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 will tell you the DMA status for your hard drives.  If you run
<B>hdparm</B> with the <CODE>-d1</CODE> parameter, it will turn DMA on.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.5">15.5</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc15.5">I keep losing all of my settings every time I compile!</A>
</H2>

<P>mythtv will overwrite any settings in <CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv</CODE>.
If you want to make sure that you don't lose your modifications, make a
directory <CODE>~/.mythtv</CODE> and copy your settings.txt file to this
location.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.6">15.6</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc15.6">Compile errors.</A>
</H2>

<P>Some compile errors are worse than others.  If you get an error that
doesn't abort the compilation, and says something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cc1plus: warning: changing search order for system directory
"/usr/local/include"
cc1plus: warning:   as it has already been specified as a non-system
directory
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

then it shouldn't be a problem.</P>
<P>If you get an error like <CODE>/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXext</CODE>, the
compiler is telling you that you don't have XFree86-devel installed, and
this needs to be fixed before mythtv will work correctly.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.7">15.7</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc15.7">My screen goes blank, but comes back when I wiggle the mouse or use the keyboard.</A>
</H2>

<P>This is due to DPMS, the Display Power Management System, which is used
to save power by turning off your monitor when the system decides that it's
not being used.  Since it's likely that watching TV will not generate
keyboard or mouse events for a time, you need to turn off DPMS.  There are a
few ways to do this.</P>
<P>You can edit your <CODE>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</CODE> file, and look for:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Section "Device"
    Identifier "device1"
    VendorName "nVidia Corporation"
    BoardName "NVIDIA GeForce 256 (generic)"
    Driver "nv"
    Option "DPMS"
EndSection
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In this case, you would need to either delete the <CODE>Option "DPMS"</CODE>
line, or change it to <CODE># Option "DPMS"</CODE> to comment it out.  The next
time you start XFree this change will take effect.</P>
<P>You can also turn off DPMS from the Command Line, but this will not survive
a reboot.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ xset -DPMS
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Using <CODE>xset +DPMS</CODE> will turn it back on.</P>
<P>Finally, depending on your distribution, you may be able to turn it off from
within the control panel.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss15.8">15.8</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc15.8">I can't checkout using CVS anymore!</A>
</H2>

<P>Isaac has changed some things around.  The CVS repository is now known as
<CODE>cvs.mythtv.org</CODE>, rather than <CODE>www.mythtv.org</CODE> or
<CODE>mythtv.org</CODE>.  Make sure you change your <CODE>CVSROOT</CODE> to point to
the new server, delete your old tree, and re-do the checkout.</P>
