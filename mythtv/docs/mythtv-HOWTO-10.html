<P><B>mythfrontend</B> is the main interface to the MythTV program.  This
program allows you to choose which of the other modules you'd like to run
and ensures that programs that you've scheduled for recording actually get
recorded, so it's important that this program is always running.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc10.1">Using themes with MythTV.</A>
</H2>

<P>MythTV is "themeable", meaning that the visual appearance of the program
can be modified by the user without re-compiling or altering the program
functionality.
<CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv/theme.txt</CODE> allows you to alter the theme
for MythTV.  The default theme is called "blue".  Other themes that ship
with MythTV can be found in the <CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv/themes</CODE>
directory.  Change the first variable in the <CODE>theme.txt</CODE> file and
exit and restart <B>mythfrontend</B> for it to take effect.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: Exiting <B>mythfrontend</B> will stop any recordings you
have in progress, so make sure that the system isn't busy if you modify the
theme while <B>mythfrontend</B> is still running.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc10.2">Adding DirecTV information to the database.</A>
</H2>

<P>A script for adding DirecTV information into the database has been
written by tarek Lubani 
<A HREF="mailto:tarek@tarek.2y.net">mailto:tarek@tarek.2y.net</A> and is
available at 
<A HREF="http://tarek.2y.net/myth/ppv.pl">http://tarek.2y.net/myth/ppv.pl</A>.  This is currently an external
user-supplied program, so if you have issues with the script, please contact
the author.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.3">10.3</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc10.3">Adding support for an external tuner.</A>
</H2>

<P>MythTV supports changing the channel on an external tuner.  If you have
an external tuner, such as a DirecTV or digital cable set top box, the
following command should be added to your settings.txt file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
str ExternalChannelCommand=/usr/local/bin/changechannel
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <B>changechannel</B> program is not supplied with MythTV, so this is
going to be dependent on what sort of external tuner you have.  Example
scripts for Sony and RCA receivers can be obtained from 
<A HREF="http://tarek.2y.net/myth/">http://tarek.2y.net/myth/</A>.  This is currently an external
user-supplied program, so if you have issues with the script, please contact
the author.</P>
<P>Feel free to browse some of what sort of hardware is available at 
<A HREF="http://shop.store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/cablepacks.html">http://shop.store.yahoo.com/snapstreammedia/cablepacks.html</A>, or if
you wish to assemble your own, rather than purchase, the following may be
