<H2><A NAME="s10">10.</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc10">Configuring mythfrontend.</A></H2>

<P>Once you have completed configuration of your backend systems, the next
step is to configure the frontend client.  You should run the MythTV setup
program before using any other modules such as MythMusic, etc. to correctly
initialize the database.</P>
<P>When you start mythfrontend, you should have a number of choices.  Before
doing anything, go to TV, then to Setup and configure the frontend client.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc10.1">General</A>
</H2>

<P>The General screen has configuration items that don't really fit anywhere
else.  The first few configuration items asks you to indicate the number of
seconds to record before or after a program, which is useful if the
broadcast network or your system clock are out of sync and will help prevent
you missing the beginning or end of a program.  </P>
<P>To change the value, use the left and right arrow keys to increment and
decrement the number of seconds.  When you're satisfied with the result, use
the down arrow to put the input focus on the Next button or press RETURN to
continue to the next page.</P>
<P>The next page has a number of options to do with how channels are displayed
on your system.  The help text will give you more information.  Move the
focus to Next and press the space bar to continue.</P>
<P>The final General page sets up some final configuration items.  See the help
text for more information.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc10.2">Appearance</A>
</H2>

<P>This set of screens is mostly concerned with how MythTV will look on your
system.  From here, you can choose different themes and set the resolution
of your system.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.3">10.3</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc10.3">Program Guide</A>
</H2>

<P>Fairly self explanatory.  Note that the alternate program guide does not
use the same font settings as defined in Appearance, so if the EPG is
unreadable this is where you make the adjustments to fonts, number of
elements displayed, etc.</P>

<H2><A NAME="deinterlace_"></A> <A NAME="ss10.4">10.4</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc10.4">Playback </A>
 </H2>

<P>The one configuration item which may cause problems on your system is the
"Deinterlace playback" setting.  MythTV uses a linear blend algorithm for
deinterlacing, which will improve how the image looks on your screen. 
Deinterlacing requires that your processor support SSE. (Streaming SIMD
Extensions, aka "MMX2").  Early Intel Celeron (those that don't use the
Coppermine 0.18um core and are usually &lt;600Mhz), Pentium Pro and Pentium II
CPUs do not have SSE, so make sure that you haven't enabled deinterlacing if
your processor doesn't support it. If you enable it, and your processor
doesn't support SSE, you will get "Illegal Instruction" errors.</P>
<P>To determine if you've got SSE on an Intel processor, you can:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo
[snip]
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca
cmov pat pse36 mmx fxsr sse
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Notice the <B>sse</B> at the end of the line - this tells you that this
processor will be able to deinterlace correctly.</P>
<P>On an AMD processor, look for "3dnow" in the cpuinfo line; "3dnow" is AMD's
implementation of SSE instructions, so if your processor has 3dnow you
shouldn't have any issues with deinterlacing.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.5">10.5</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc10.5">Recording </A>
</H2>

<P>Currently, MythTV supports a number of different video encoders. There
are two software options and two hardware options. The software options are
MPEG-4 and RTJPEG. The hardware options are MPEG-2 and Hardware MJPEG. Take
note that RTJPEG has lower CPU demands than MPEG-4, but makes large files,
while MPEG-4 has higher CPU demands than RTJPEG, but makes smaller files.
Hardware MJPEG is only for use with MJPEG capture devices (Zoran-based
cards; see 
<A HREF="http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net">http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net</A>). MPEG-2 is the format used by the
hardware-based PVR-x50 encoder. Note that MPEG-2 is not a selectable option
in the Recording setup option, but this is what PVR-x50 cards will always
use for initial video capture (which can later be transcoded), regardless of
what codec you choose for Default and/or Live TV.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: although the width and height can be changed to almost
anything, if you start MythTV and don't see video or you get "segmentation
fault" errors, it is likely that the video4linux (v4l) subsystem did not
like the height and width parameters specified.  It's best to leave the
default as-is until you're sure that MythTV is operational.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.6">10.6</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc10.6">Xbox Frontends</A>
</H2>

<P>MythTV is able to control the LED on the Xbox to indicate backend
recording status.  </P>
<P>To control the LED, you will need the <B>blink</B> program from the
xbox-linux project, which is installed as <CODE>/bin/led</CODE> on GentooX.  On
Xebian (the new Ed's Debian) you must install it yourself.  On other
distributions it may or may not be installed as a program called
<B>blink</B> and should be located in your path.  (Type <CODE>which
blink</CODE> to see if the program is available.) If you do not have
<B>blink</B>, you may obtain it from the Xbox-Linux project site at 
<A HREF="http://xbox-linux.sf.net/">http://xbox-linux.sf.net/</A>. The
program you need is part of the <CODE>eds_i2c_staff</CODE> module in CVS.  Note
the spelling.</P>
<P>Once you have installed <B>blink</B> you will need to set permissions. 
<B>blink</B> needs write permission to the i2c device to function
properly.  There are three methods to accomplish this.  First, you could run
<CODE>mythfrontend</CODE> as root, which is the simplest method, but could
potentially be a security risk.  Next, you may make the <B>blink</B>
binary setuid root, which allows non-privileged users to run a program with
root capability.  This is done by typing the command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# chmod u+s /path/to/blink
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The final technique would be to set the <CODE>/dev/i2c/0</CODE> device read/write
for all users, but this is the least preferred method.</P>
<P>Now it's time to setup MythTV for Xbox hardware.  Enter Setup -> General. 
On the second page check the 'Enable Xbox Hardware' option.  Upon reentering
the settings, you should have a new option named 'Xbox'.  Within this option
you may select the distribution, LED colors for recording and the update
interval.  If you select GentooX as the distribution <B>led</B> will be
used as the <B>blink</B> binary name, otherwise, <B>blink</B> is used. 
Colors should be self explanatory.  The update interval determines how often
the frontend should poll the backend to determine if the status has changed.</P>
