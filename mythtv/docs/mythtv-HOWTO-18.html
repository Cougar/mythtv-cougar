<P>Matthew Zimmerman has created a patch for MPlayer / Mencoder 
<A HREF="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">http://www.mplayerhq.hu</A> that allows
you view the files created by MythTV.  MythTV doesn't use standard
Nupplevideo files, which is why you MPlayer complains if you try to view
them.</P>

</H2>

<P>While MythTV allows you to set various GUI and capture resolutions, not
all combinations make sense.</P>
<P>First, analog video signals have a defined vertical resolution.  In NTSC,
the video standard specifies that there are 525 vertical scan lines.  Once
the "extra" lines are removed (they're used to synchronize the video signal,
and encode closed captioning data), you have 480 vertical lines.</P>
<P>In PAL, there are 625 "raw" lines of resolution, with a net of 576 vertical
lines.</P>
<P>Horizontally, the maximum you can expect from a Bt8X8 chip is 720.</P>
<P>With this in mind, there are certain commonly accepted values for
resolution.  While other values may be accepted, they will cause scan lines
to be repeated or dropped.</P>
<P>From "best" to "worst", in NTSC:
<UL>
<LI>720x480 (but more commonly, 704x480.  "DVD" resolution)</LI>
<LI>640x480 4:3</LI>
<LI>544x480 (TiVo high resolution)</LI>
<LI>480x480 (Video CD resolution)</LI>
<LI>352x480 (ReplayTV "Standard" quality)</LI>
<LI>320x480 </LI>
<LI>544x240</LI>
<LI>480x240 </LI>
<LI>352x240 </LI>
<LI>320x240</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>As you can see, the lower quality values are half of the better ones. 
720x240 is possible, but isn't a good tradeoff relative to the number of
vertical lines lost.  In a PAL country, the you would use values like
720x576 or x288.</P>
<P>The higher resolutions will be more CPU intensive. If the CPU is overtaxed,
frames will be dropped causing uneven motion. You will likely see the best
results at resolutions which average at least 10% CPU idle time (meaning
that the first value shown in the load average using <CODE>w</CODE> or
<CODE>top</CODE> is no more than .90) while recording.  If the load average is
consistently exceeding .90, your CPU will not have enough cycles to service
other system events, thereby causing frame drops when it context switches
away from MythTV to service other processes.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.5">18.5</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc18.5">MythTV GUI and X Display Sizes.</A>
</H2>

<P>MythTV is designed to be run as dedicated full screen TV application
but can also be run as a desktop application on a computer
monitor. Here are a few consideration for configuring sizes to best
suit you needs.</P>
<P>There are three sizes that are important for matching the MythTV GUI and
full screen TV playback to fit the screen:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>the X display size</LI>
<LI>the X Desktop (virtual) dimensions</LI>
<LI>the MythTV GUI dimensions</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The MythTV GUI uses its GUI dimensions regardless of the other two and is
anchored to the upper left corner of the X Desktop.</P>
<P>The MythTV full screen mode uses the X display size dimensions regardless of
the other two and is anchored to the upper left corner of the X display.</P>

<H3>X Dimensions</H3>

<P>For output to a Television, common resolutions are 640x480, 800x600, and
some rare devices support 1024x768. Generally, higher resolutions are
better. However, you may find that you prefer the picture quality at one of
the lower resolutions. Everything in MythTV is scalable and should 'fit'
regardless of the resolution you choose.</P>
<P>Edit your X configuration file, usually "XF86Config-4", so that the the
resolution you want to use is listed first in the lists under "Screen". If
this resolution is higher than the resolutions supported by your output
device, you will see a 'panning' effect where moving the mouse to the edge
will scroll around a desktop area which is larger than the display size. If
this happens, edit your X configuration file to match the display size then
restart X.</P>

<H3>MythTV Dimensions</H3>

<P>Set the MythTV GUI size to these same dimensions as the X display. In
0.7, edit the file <CODE>themes.txt</CODE>. In 0.8, from "mythfrontend" go to
Setup->Appearance.  To ensure that your new dimension settings, exit and
restart MythTV.  </P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: When the GUI is full screen, you may need to set your window
manager to 'Click to Focus' for windows to stack properly.</P>
<P>The fonts for the GUI and OSD will scale to whatever sizes you use. Most
font sizes can be changed in setup selections. Make sure to use fonts large
enough to be read on a TV screen from a distance.</P>
<P>The full screen TV size is based on the X display size. For Xinerama, you
can specify a screen in Setup->General. The picture will be stretched to fit
the entire screen regardless of the 
<A HREF="#capture_resolution_">capture resolutions</A> used.</P>

<H3>Overscan Dimensions</H3>

<P>Because picture edges can be ragged and screen edges aren't straight,
Television is designed to project an image larger than the physical screen.
This is called "overscan". Underscan is fitting the entire image inside the
screen. This is useful for computer monitors so that toolbars and scrollbars
at the edges can be seen.</P>
<P>For best results, match the X display area as close as possible to the edges
of the physical screen. This can only be adjusted by your tv-out device or
by the settings for the television set. Many sets have these adjustments in
a 'service mode'.</P>
<P>MythTV has settings for "Overscan" in Setup->Playback. These can not, and do
not, cause the image to display beyond the edge of the X display area. The
purpose of these settings are to cut off rough edges and to expand the image
so that objects will appear to be the same size as a normal overscanned TV
picture.</P>

<H3>MythTV on the Desktop</H3>

<P>When using MythTV on a high resolution desktop monitor, set the MythTV
GUI dimensions to something much smaller than your X display resolution but
still large enough to read the fonts. The GUI screens will always be in the
upper left hand corner. However, your window manager may be able to minimize
these (ALT-F4 in KDE for example).</P>
<P>The TV picture will start in full screen mode. Press "f" to put the picture
in a window that can be moved and resized. By default, the picture uses the
recording resolution for its dimensions. If you check the box "Fixed
Aspect Ratio" in Setup->Playback, the windowed picture will always be
resized to normal 4:3 shape.</P>

<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Performing this step will remove the entire database. 
You will lose all of your settings and will need to re-run the mc.sql script
to setup the database structure before running the setup program.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.7">18.7</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc18.7">I'd like to start using the development version of MythTV.</A>
</H2>

<P>[Content under development]</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:It should be clear that using the development version of
MythTV may cause loss of data on your system.  There is no guarantee that the development
version of MythTV will work for you.</P>
<P><B>THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL WORK.  USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK.</B></P>
<P>Here are some of the features in version 0.8:
<UL>
<LI>A front-end and back-end system.  The back-end is responsible for
maintaining the database and capturing and encoding the video.  The
front-end is responsible for displaying the video.  This allows you to put a
lightweight, quiet, diskless and fanless machine in "the living room", with a large server-type
machine in "the basement".  The front-end and back-end communicate over TCP
on a specified port.</LI>
<LI>GUI-based configuration.  Much of the configuration of MythTV can now
be done using a GUI-based setup, avoiding the necessity to edit the
<CODE>settings.txt</CODE> file.</LI>
<LI>Themes.  MythTV now has more themes for the user to choose from.</LI>
<LI>Recording profiles.  You may now setup various encoder profiles from
the GUI, giving you the flexibility to record programs using various quality
levels.</LI>
<LI>Increased hardware encoder support.  MythTV can now use the MJPEG
encoder/decoder found on Matrox G200 series cards.  This greatly reduces the
CPU utilization.</LI>
<LI>Commercial Skipping</LI>
<LI>Mixer control for volume and muting functionality</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Problem reports for version 0.8 posted to the mailing list
should have accompanying solutions.</P>
<P>Before you begin, shutdown all running instances of 0.7.  You should perform
a <CODE>make clean distclean</CODE> before starting the compile process.</P>
<P>Compile and install the system as you would MythTV 0.7 by following the
instructions found in this HOWTO.  If you are installing MythTV on a new
machine, install the database by running the <CODE>database/mc.sql</CODE>
script as detailed in earlier sections of this document.</P>
<P>However, if you are upgrading an existing 0.7 system, you <EM>must</EM> run the
<CODE>database/0-7-to-0-8.sql</CODE> script before running the setup program to
ensure that the database structure is up to date.</P>
<P>Once you're done editing the file, start the setup program:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cd setup
$ ./setup
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This will open the setup wizard which will allow you to graphically
configure your system.</P>
<P>Once the setup wizard is done: to run the new version of MythTV, you must
first start the back-end server:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ mythbackend &amp;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>and then run the front-end client:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ mythfrontend
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You should see the connection established between the front-end and back-end
systems by examining the mythbackend window; it will display the client
connection attempts.</P>
<P>The cvs version of MythTV now supports pressing the ESC key to exit the
application.  If you wish to configure MythTV to exit on ESC, go to the
mythfrontend setup screen (not the setup program used to initially configure
MythTV) and enter the General configuration screen.  Move through the setup
until you get to the System Shutdown parameter.  By default, this is set to
"No exit key", which means there is no defined exit key for MythTV.  If you
set it to "ESC", this will mean that the ESC key is used to exit
MythTV.  Control, Meta and ALT modifiers mean that the Modifier + ESC key
must be pressed to activate the exit from MythTV function.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Users that have been running the frontend and the backend on
different machines using Red Hat Linux 8.0 have stated that they have been
having issues with remote access of the MySQL database.  This is not yet a
supported configuration.  The following instructions may or may not work. 
Add the following to <CODE>/etc/my.cnf</CODE> on the backend machine.
