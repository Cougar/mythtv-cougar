</H2>

<P>Matthew Zimmerman has created a patch for MPlayer / Mencoder
<A HREF="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">http://www.mplayerhq.hu</A> that allows
you view the files created by MythTV.  MythTV doesn't use standard
Nupplevideo files, which is why you MPlayer complains if you try to view
them.</P>
<P>Download the patch to MPlayer from Matt's website.

<P>At this point, you can read the MPlayer documentation and start the compile

<P>MythTV is not dependent on any particular window manager.  If you wish to
run a lightweight window manager, the <CODE>configfiles/</CODE> directory has an
example of a <CODE>.twmrc</CODE> file you may use.</P>

</H2>

<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Performing this step will remove the entire database. 
You will lose all of your settings and will need to re-run the mc.sql script
to setup the database structure before running the setup program.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.5">18.5</A> <A HREF="mythtv-HOWTO.html#toc18.5">I'd like to start using the development version of MythTV.</A>
</H2>

<P>[Content under development]</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:It should be clear that using the development version of
MythTV may cause loss of data on your system.  There is no guarantee that the development
version of MythTV will work for you.</P>
<P><B>THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL WORK.  USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK.</B></P>
<P>Here are some of the features in version 0.8:
<UL>
<LI>A front-end and back-end system.  The back-end is responsible for
maintaining the database and capturing and encoding the video.  The
front-end is responsible for displaying the video.  This allows you to put a
lightweight, quiet, diskless and fanless machine in "the living room", with a large server-type
machine in "the basement".  The front-end and back-end communicate over TCP
on a specified port.</LI>
<LI>GUI-based configuration.  Much of the configuration of MythTV can now
be done using a GUI-based setup, avoiding the necessity to edit the
<CODE>settings.txt</CODE> file.</LI>
<LI>Themes.  MythTV now has more themes for the user to choose from.</LI>
<LI>Recording profiles.  You may now setup various encoder profiles from
the GUI, giving you the flexibility to record programs using various quality
levels.</LI>
<LI>Increased hardware encoder support.  MythTV can now use the MJPEG
encoder/decoder found on Matrox G200 series cards.  This greatly reduces the
CPU utilization.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Problem reports for version 0.8 posted to the mailing list
should have accompanying solutions.</P>
<P>Before you begin, shutdown all running instances of 0.7.  You should perform
a <CODE>make clean distclean</CODE> before starting the compile process.</P>
<P>Compile and install the system as you would MythTV 0.7 by following the
instructions found in this HOWTO.  If you are installing MythTV on a new
machine, install the database by running the <CODE>database/mc.sql</CODE>
script as detailed in earlier sections of this document.</P>
<P>However, if you are upgrading an existing 0.7 system, you <EM>must</EM> run the
<CODE>database/0-7-to-0-8.sql</CODE> script before running the setup program to
ensure that the database structure is up to date.</P>
<P>Next, you must edit the
<CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv/backend_settings.txt</CODE> file.  Specify the IP
address or hostname of the back-end server and port.  You may specify
<CODE>localhost</CODE> if the front-end and back-end programs will be running on
the same machine.  This file is read by the backend server during start-up.</P>
<P>Once you're done editing the file, start the setup program:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cd setup
$ ./setup
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This will open the setup wizard which will allow you to graphically
configure your system.</P>
<P>Once the setup wizard is done: to run the new version of MythTV, you must
first start the back-end server:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ mythbackend &amp;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>and then run the front-end client:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ mythfrontend
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You should see the connection established between the front-end and back-end
systems by examining the mythbackend window; it will display the client
connection attempts.</P>
<P>The cvs version of MythTV now supports pressing the ESC key to exit the
application.  If you wish to configure MythTV to exit on ESC, go to the
mythfrontend setup screen (not the setup program used to initially configure
MythTV) and enter the General configuration screen.  Move through the setup
until you get to the System Shutdown parameter.  By default, this is set to
"No exit key", which means there is no defined exit key for MythTV.  If you
set it to "ESC", this will mean that the ESC key is used to exit
MythTV.  Control, Meta and ALT modifiers mean that the Modifier + ESC key
must be pressed to activate the exit from MythTV function.</P>
