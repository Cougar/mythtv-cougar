<EM>Initially, installation of MythTV seems like a huge task.  There are lots
of dependencies, and various distributions seem to do the same thing
different ways.  This document will attempt to give general installation
instructions, as well as including distribution-specific instructions where
necessary.</EM>

<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>: Please note that I am <EM>NOT</EM> the author/programmer of
the MythTV application!  I can not give you personalized installation

</H2>

<P>MythTV is a GPL licensed suite of programs that allow you to build the
mythical home media convergence box on your own using Open Source software
and operating systems.</P>
<P>MythTV has a number of capabilities.  The television portion allows you to
do the following:
<UL>
<LI>You may pause, fast-forward and rewind live Television.</LI>
<LI>You may install multiple video capture cards to record more than one
program at a time.</LI>
<LI>You can have multiple servers, each with multiple capture cards in
them.  All servers are centrally managed and all programs are scheduled by the
Master backend.</LI>
<LI>You can have multiple clients (called "frontends" in MythTV parlance),
each with a common view of all available programs.  Any client can watch any
program that was recorded by any of the servers.  Clients can be diskless
and controlled entirely by a remote control.</LI>
<LI>You may use any combination of standard analog capture card, MPEG-2,
MJPEG, DVB or HDTV capture devices.  With appropriate hardware, MythTV can
control set top boxes, often found in digital cable and satellite TV
systems.</LI>
<LI>Program Guide Data in North America is downloaded from Zap2It.com, a
subsidiary of Tribune Media Services.  This free service is called
DataDirect, and provides MythTV almost two weeks of scheduling information. 
Program Guide Data in other countries is obtained using XMLTV.  MythTV uses
this information to create a schedule that maximizes the number of programs
that can be recorded if you don't have enough tuners.</LI>
</UL>
 
Other modules in MythTV include:
<UL>
<LI>MythGallery, a picture-viewing application</LI>
<LI>MythVideo, a media-viewer for content not created within MythTV</LI>
<LI>MythDVD, a DVD viewer / ripper</LI>
<LI>MythMusic, a music playing / ripping application which supports MP3
and FLAC</LI>
<LI>MythGame</LI>
<LI>MythWeather</LI>
<LI>MythNews, a RSS news grabber</LI>
<LI>MythBrowser, a web browser</LI>
<LI>MythWeb, which allows you to control your MythTV system using a web
browser.  With MythWeb, you can schedule recordings, delete files, change
keybindings and more.  With proper security, you may even schedule a program
over the Internet and have it immediately acted on by the scheduler.</LI>
<LI>MythPhone, phone and videophone using SIP.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Custom mini-distributions are available to make it easier to install
MythTV.  A mini-distribution removes many of the "general purpose"
workstation / server software packages that may be installed by default if
you use one of the big-name OS packages.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="#toc3.1">Hardware</A>
</H2>

<P>Hardware selection is a complex topic, one this HOWTO will only discuss
briefly and in general terms. The following subsections offer some general 
guidance but stop short of offering specific recommendations.</P>
<P>For a good MythTV experience, you must understand that MythTV exercises your
hardware more than a typical desktop. Encoder cards generate DMA across the
PCI bus.  The CPU is busy encoding / decoding video. Hard drives are
constantly reading and writing data. Building a MythTV system on older /
"spare" hardware may be an exercise in frustration and can waste many hours
of valuable time.</P>
<P>For more detail about actual configurations that others have used, Mark
Cooper has setup a hardware database at 
<A HREF="http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/">http://pvrhw.goldfish.org/</A>. The
website will let you browse what other users have reported as their hardware
configuration, and how happy they are with the results.</P>
<P>If you have specific questions about the suitability of specific hardware
choices, you can consult the archives of the mythtv-users mailing list at
<A HREF="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/</A> or
post a question to the list.</P>
<H3>CPU Type and Speed</H3>

<P>Selection of CPU type and speed is one of the trickiest elements of
hardware selection, mainly because there are so many tradeoffs which can be
made.  For example, if you have plenty of CPU, you can use higher bitrates
or capture sizes, etc.</P>
<P>MythTV has two modes of operation.  First, it can function as a software video
encoder, which means that it uses a fairly generic "dumb" video capture card
to get frames of video, encodes them using the CPU on your motherboard and
writes them to disk.  High-end video capture cards and devices like the TiVo
and ReplayTV have dedicated encoder chips which use specialized hardware to
convert the video stream to the MPEG-2 format without using the motherboard
CPU.  The main CPU has the responsibility of running the Operating System
and reading and writing the encoded frames to the disk.  These tasks have
fairly low CPU requirements compared to encoding video, which is why a
device like a Series 1 TiVo can run with only 16MB of RAM and a 54MHz CPU.</P>
<P>There are many variables that go into the question: "How fast a CPU do I
need to run MythTV"?  Obviously, the faster your CPU, the better your
experience will be with MythTV.  If you are using the software MPEG-4
encoder and performing the "Watch TV" function, where the CPU is both
encoding and decoding video simultaneously to allow Pause, Fast Forward and
Rewind functions for live TV requires more CPU then just encoding or
decoding.  MythTV also supports multiple encoder cards in a single PC,
thereby increasing the CPU requirements if you plan on simultaneously
encoding multiple programs.  As a general guideline, plan on 1GHz per
encoder if you are doing software-based encoding, less if you are using a
hardware-based encoder.</P>
<P>Here are a few data points:
<UL>
<LI>A PIII/733MHz system can encode one video stream using the MPEG-4
codec using 480x480 capture resolution.  This does not allow for live TV
watching, but does allow for encoding video and then watching it later.</LI>
<LI>A developer states that his AMD1800+ system can <B>almost</B>
encode two MPEG-4 video streams and watch one program simultaneously.</LI>
<LI>A PIII/800MHz system with 512MB RAM can encode one video
stream using the RTjpeg codec with 480x480 capture resolution and play it back
simultaneously, thereby allowing live TV watching.</LI>
<LI>A dual Celeron/450MHz is able to view a 480x480 MPEG-4/3300kbps file
created on a different system with 30% CPU usage.</LI>
<LI>A P4 2.4GHz machine can encode two 3300Kbps 480x480 MPEG-4 files and
simultaneously serve content to a remote frontend.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The second mode of operation is where MythTV is paired with a hardware-based
video encoder, such as a Matrox G200 or a Hauppauge
WinTV-PVR-150/250/350/500.  In this mode, because the video encoding is
being done by a dedicated video processor, the host CPU requirements are
quite low.  See the 
<A HREF="#video_capture_device">Video Capture Device</A> section for details.</P>
<P>If you have a Via M10000 series or a Hauppauge PVR-350, MythTV can use the
hardware-based video decoder for playback, which further reduces CPU
requirements.</P>

<H3>Memory</H3>

<P>A MythTV host that is both a backend and a frontend and using software
encoding with a single capture card should run adequately in 256MB of RAM.
Additional RAM above 256MB will not necessarily increase performance, but
may be useful if you are running multiple encoders.</P>

<H3>Hard Disk(s)</H3>

<P>Encoded video takes up a lot of hard disk space. The exact amount depends
on the encoding scheme, the size of the raw images and the frames per
second, but typical values for MythTV range from 700 megabytes/hour for
MPEG-4, 2 GB/hour for MPEG-2 and RTjpeg and 7 GB/hour for ATSC HDTV.</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="stop.eps">
<IMG SRC="stop.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  You <EM>must</EM> use DMA for hard drive access to prevent
choppy or jittery video.  Not all distributions enable DMA at boot time. See the Troubleshooting Section for 
<A HREF="#Setting_DMA">instructions</A> on how to do this.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>
</P>
<P>Writing video to disk is sensitive to timing issues; RTjpeg requires less
CPU with the tradeoff being larger files and needing to write to the disk
faster.  MPEG-4 requires more CPU, but the files are smaller.  At the
default resolution, MPEG-2 creates the largest files of all with almost no
CPU impact.</P>
<P>See the Troubleshooting 
<A HREF="#Setting_DMA">section</A> for more
information.</P>

<H3>Filesystems</H3>

<P>MythTV creates large files, many in excess of 2GB.  You <EM>must</EM> use a
filesystem that will allow you to create large files.  Filesystems known to
have problems with large files are FAT and FAT32.</P>
<P>Because MythTV creates very large files, a filesystem that does well at
deleting large files is important.  Numerous benchmarks show that XFS and
JFS do very well at this task.  You are strongly encouraged to consider
either of these for your MythTV filesystem.</P>
<P>Because of the size of the MythTV files, it may be useful to plan for future
expansion right from the beginning.  If your case and power supply have the
capacity for additional hard drives, read through the 
<A HREF="#LVM">LVM</A> and 
<A HREF="#advancedpartitionformatting">Advanced Partition Formatting</A> sections for some pointers.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="video_capture_device"></A> </P>
<H3>Video Capture Device </H3>

<P>In order to capture video, MythTV will need one or more video capture
devices with Linux drivers.  There are a number of classes of hardware
available for capturing video.  </P>
<H3>Frame Grabbers.</H3>

<P>This class of card is the simplest and is usually the cheapest.  There is no
on-board encoding of the analog video; hardware known as a Digital-Analog
Converter (DAC) takes the video and presents it to the computer in an
essentially raw digital form.</P>
<P>For a list of video capture cards known to work with Linux, please see
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/video4linux/bttv</CODE> for a partial
listing; even if your specific card is not listed, it may be that the vendor
is actually using a standard reference design and placing their own name on
it.  See the video4linux mailing list (
<A HREF="https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list">https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/video4linux-list</A>) for
more information and for specific hardware questions.</P>
<P>The most common inexpensive cards available use the Bt848 or Bt878 video
capture chip; examples are the "Hauppauge WinTV Go" card and the "AverTV
Desktop PVR" card, both of which use the bttv kernel module.</P>

<H3>Hardware MPEG-2 encoders.</H3>

<P>While inexpensive video-capture cards simply capture raw frames, leaving
encoding to software, some higher-end cards incorporate hardware-based
encoding. Using either a G200 MJPEG encoder card, or a MPEG-2 encoder card
supported by the IvyTV project 
<A HREF="http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/">http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/</A> such as the Hauppauge
PVR-150/250/350/500, Avermedia M179, Hauppauge "Freestyle" or Yuan M600
cards will allow you to use dedicated hardware encoders rather than your
CPU. (The PVR-350 can simultaneously be used as an output device.) Using the
on-board MPEG-2 encoder drastically reduces the CPU requirements for
encoding.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  Motherboards with the Via chipset are notoriously bad with
DMA and have caused numerous issues with ivtv, including hard locks.  See

<H3>DVB capture cards.</H3>

<P>DVB is a video standard primarily found in Europe.  MythTV supports DVB;
see the pages maintained by Martin Smith 
<A HREF="mailto:martin@ethics-gradient.net">martin@ethics-gradient.net</A>

<A HREF="http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb/CARDS">http://www.linuxtv.org/download/dvb/CARDS</A> for more information.</P>
<P>In the United States, you may use a card such as the TwinHan to obtain
unencrypted Free-To-Air satellite channels.</P>

<H3>HDTV.</H3>

<P>Currently there are two HDTV card with Linux drivers which are known to
operate in the United States - the HD-2000/HD-3000 cards available from
<A HREF="http://www.pchdtv.com/">http://www.pchdtv.com/</A> or 
<A HREF="http://mythic.tv/">http://mythic.tv/</A> and the Air2PC-ATSC-PCI
available from 
<A HREF="http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=103">http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=103</A>
or 
<A HREF="http://mythic.tv/">http://mythic.tv/</A>. </P>
<P> The
Air2PC is supported using the linux-dvb drivers.</P>
<P>To playback HDTV content, plan on a powerful CPU.  "How powerful?" depends
on a number of factors, such as the capture resolution, whether the video is
progressive or interlaced, and whether your display card has hardware-assist
support for Linux. For 720p content (1280x720), a 2.4GHz P4 should be
sufficient.</P>
<P>For 1920x1080i->1920x1080p with the better deinterlacing methods
done in real time a 2.4GHz CPU is taxed, but should work if you use "Bob and
Weave" deinterlacing, or if you have an NVIDIA card with MPEG-2 hardware
acceleration.  If you enable the hardware acceleration, you may be able to
use a 1.8GHz processor.</P>

<H3>Firewire.</H3>

<P>You may use the Firewire output of the DCT6200 or the SA3250.</P>

<H3>DBoxII or other devices running Neutrino</H3>

<P>You may use the Ethernet port of an DBoxII or a similar device to capture 
MPEG2. Your set top box has to be running the Neutrino GUI. </P>

available from 
<A HREF="http://www.plextor.com/english/support/LinuxSDK.htm">http://www.plextor.com/english/support/LinuxSDK.htm</A>. MythTV uses the
Plextor to capture hardware encoded MPEG-4, so the host CPU requirements are low.</P>

<H3>Sound card</H3>

<P>The system needs a sound card or an on-board equivalent on the motherboard
to play back and in most cases, to record sound. Any sound card that can be
operated by the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) kernel modules will
work with MythTV.  However, some cards and drivers will provide better
quality or compatibility than others.  In particular, many audio
devices included on motherboards can be problematic.</P>
<P>The usual practice for capturing the audio associated with the video
is to run a cable from an audio output on the video capture card to
the Line input on a sound card. However, some video capture cards
provide on-board audio capabilities that work with the kernel
<CODE>btaudio</CODE> module instead, thereby eliminating the need for a
cable.  This is useful if you will be using multiple capture cards in
a single chassis, since each capture card will not need its own sound
card.  Note that a separate sound card is still required for playback
when using <CODE>btaudio</CODE>, and that often the audio recorded in this
way will be mono only.  See the 
<A HREF="#btaudio">btaudio</A>
section for more information.</P>

<H3>Video Display Card</H3>

<P>MythTV will work with just about any video card.  However, it is highly
recommended that you use a card which supports XVideo (XV) extensions. If
your card does not support XV, color conversion and scaling will be
performed by your CPU rather than the video card.  This is very CPU
and memory intensive and will often result in dropped frames and a
corresponding degradation of quality.  Check the XFree86 documentation
for details if you are uncertain about your preferred card.  You may
also run <CODE>xvinfo</CODE>; look for your video card to be listed as one
of the adapters.</P>

<P>If you want to use MythTV with a standard television, you will need a
physical connection from your video card to your TV set, which can either be
a TV-out port on the card itself or an external adapter that converts the
VGA signal to an appropriate video signal. "Appropriate" depends on a number
of factors, such as video standard (NTSC vs. PAL) type of input connection
(Composite vs. SVideo), etc.</P>
<P>Note that with some video cards and X drivers, XVideo extensions are
only supported on the VGA output, and not on the TV output.</P>

<H3>Cards with TV out</H3>

<P>The next section deals with a number of cards that are known to have
TV-out ports.  The list is unlikely to be complete, so if you know of
others, please post a message to the mythtv-users mailing list so the
information can be included in future versions of the HOWTO. The list is

<H3>Matrox</H3>

<P>The standard Matrox driver included with XFree86 does not support TV-out.</P>
<P>Older Matrox cards can be used with a proprietary X driver provided by 
Matrox, and it does simultaneously support TV out and XVideo on some cards.

<P>Newer Matrox cards can be run with a set of kernel patches (for kernel 
2.4.19) and a customized X driver, but this arrangement does not support 
XVideo on TV-out. See

<H3>NVIDIA</H3>

<P>Some NVIDIA cards with TV-out can be run using the standard nv driver in 
XFree86, combined with the userspace application <B>nvtv</B> to control the TV-out 
port. See 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/nv-tv-out/</A> for details.  Recent
versions of the NVIDIA driver have better support for overscan and other
features useful with TV-Out, so the <B>nvtv</B> application may not be
required.</P>
<P>Some NVIDIA cards can be run with a proprietary NVIDIA X driver made
available by NVIDIA. See

<P>MythTV supports the TV-out and MPEG-2 decoder functions in the IvyTV
driver.</P>
<P>The PVR-350 is unique in that it also supports audio output. However, as of
MythTV 0.17, the IvyTV drivers do not support volume control.  There are two
courses of action you may take:
<OL>
<LI>Take the audio output from the PVR-350 and plug it into an input on a
sound card on your machine.  You may then use MythTV's internal audio
controls.</LI>
<LI>Take the audio output from the PVR-350 and connect it directly to your television / audio system.  
You must indicate that you are using external audio control on the PVR-350 setup page.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>Other Options</H3>

<P>Some devices with on-board TV-out capability, such as Xboxes converted to

clicking K->Configuration->Packaging->KPackage</P>
<P>While the graphical tools are nice, the command line tool is actually easier
to use.  It's strongly recommended that you use the command line tool.</P>
<P>There are many inter-related modules, so make sure that you've got the
main package for each one, and not a sub package for an unrelated item.  For
example, there are many modules that have "perl" in them; some are a part of
the apache web server, others are a part of the perl distribution.  In each
case, we're looking to make sure that the primary module is getting
installed.</P>
<P>Click the magnifying glass or press <B>CTRL-F</B> and enter "perl" as your
search term.  You should find it under the "Perl" folder.  You need at least
the perl 5.80 base package installed.  If not, click on the "Mark" button.</P>
<P>If you are going to be installing MySQL on this system, search for mysql -
it should be under "Databases".  Make sure that mysql and mysql-clients are
installed.  If not, click on "Mark".</P>
<P>Search for gcc.  You're going to need gcc and gcc-c++ installed.</P>
<P>Search for freetype2.  Make sure that you've got freetype2 and
freetype2-devel installed.</P>
<P>Search for XFree86-devel.</P>
<P>Finally, check for qt.  You'll need libqt3-devel (under folder "KDE and
Qt") and libqt3 ("Libraries").</P>

command line, but properly configuring it can be difficult.  The
following website 
<A HREF="http://addmedia.linuxfornewbies.org/">http://addmedia.linuxfornewbies.org/</A> will allow you to choose
a mirror site and then present the command-line configuration text for that
mirror.  You will most likely need to add a "Contrib" mirror to your setup. 
If you add a site from the "Penguin Liberation Front", you will be able to
load the <CODE>lame</CODE> library without compiling from source.</P>

<H3>Mandrake 9.0</H3>

<P>The simplest tool for installing packages from the command line is
<B>urpmi</B>.</P>
<P>Open a shell, and execute the following, all on the same line. You may get
asked a number of questions regarding dependencies.  It's best to answer
"YES".

<H2><A NAME="Setting_up_paths"></A> <A NAME="s4">4.</A> <A HREF="#toc4">System Configuration Requirements for Compiling MythTV. </A></H2>

<P>Before you compile MythTV from the current source tarball or from
<B>subversion</B>, you may need to modify your system configuration in a
few ways.</P>
<P>In general, if you install MythTV from pre-packaged binaries for your Linux
distribution/version, you don't need to be too concerned about the issues in
this section of the HOWTO - the install script for the packages should take
care of them. However, this section is still recommended reading which may
help if the packager skipped a step in their packaging.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="#toc4.1">Software requirements for compiling MythTV</A>
</H2>

<H3>General requirements</H3>

<P>MythTV is written in C++ and requires a fairly complete, but standard, 
compilation environment, including a recent g++ compiler, <CODE>make</CODE>, and 
appropriate headers files for shared libraries. Any standard Linux 
distribution should be able to install a suitable compilation environment 
from its packaging system. Section 3.2 of this HOWTO provides some details 
of how to install the required environment for many distributions.</P>
<P>Subsequent sections of this chapter address the few oddities that you may 
have to adjust by hand before you compile MythTV.</P>
<P>The reference compilation system for MythTV is Debian.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="#toc4.2">Shared-Library Requirements for MythTV </A>
</H2>

<H3><A NAME="modifying_ld.so.conf"></A> Modifying /etc/ld.so.conf </H3>

<P>The runtime manager for shared libraries, <B>/lib/ld.so</B>, gets
information about the locations and contents of shared libraries from
<CODE>/etc/ld.so.cache</CODE>, a file created by <B>ldconfig</B> from
information in <CODE>/etc/ld.so.conf</CODE>.  Because MythTV installs some
shared libraries in <CODE>/usr/local/lib</CODE>, that directory needs to be
added to the list of directories for <B>ld.so</B> to search when doing
runtime linking of programs, if it is not already there.
You do this, as root, by editing <CODE>/etc/ld.so.conf</CODE>, then
running <B>ldconfig</B>. There are many ways to do this; one that
works is to enter this series of commands:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

# echo /usr/local/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf

</H2>

<H3>General requirements</H3>

<H3>QT libraries and binaries</H3>

<P>The compiler needs to be able to locate QT binaries and libraries in
order to compile MythTV. QTDIR needs to be set and the directory holding the
QT binaries needs to be added to your PATH.  Your distribution may already
be making these changes as a part of the installation of the software
prerequisites detailed earlier.</P>
<P>One way to do this is as follows: 
<A NAME="Checking_that_it_worked"></A> </P>
<P>Open a shell and execute the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games:/usr/lib/qt3/bin:/home/mythtv/bin:/usr/lib/qt3/bin
$ echo $QTDIR
/usr/lib/qt3
$ which qmake
/usr/lib/qt3/bin/qmake
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>For Mandrake, you should see a value like <CODE>/usr/lib/qt3</CODE> for
<CODE>QTDIR</CODE> and <CODE>/usr/lib/qt3/bin</CODE> should be in $PATH.</P>
<P>For Gentoo, you should see a value like <CODE>/usr/qt/3</CODE> for <CODE>QTDIR</CODE> 
and <CODE>/usr/qt/3/bin</CODE> should be in $PATH.</P>
<P>If you don't, do not proceed past this step until you have resolved this
error. You may need to manually specify the QTDIR and PATH at the shell
prompt before compiling.</P>
<P>Also, check that there has been a link created in
<CODE>/usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs</CODE> (<CODE>/usr/share/qt3/mkspecs</CODE> for Debian)
called <CODE>default</CODE>. If not, you'll get errors during the compile. See
the Troubleshooting Section for more information.</P>

<P>Zap2It DataDirect is a service provided by Zap2It, a subsidiary of
Tribune Media Services.  TMS is one of the primary providers for program
listing data in the United States and Canada.  There are a number of
advantages to using DataDirect rather than the standard XMLTV
<CODE>tv_grab_na</CODE> grabber.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The <CODE>tv_grab_na</CODE> grabber is no longer supported and will not be
fixed when problems occur.</LI>
<LI>It's much faster, because the grabber isn't downloading hundreds of
HTML pages and trying to parse the program data out of the HTML.</LI>
<LI>It contains more program information.</LI>
<LI>It's easier on the Zap2It servers, since they're not generating
hundreds of custom HTML pages when you scrape their listings.</LI>
<LI>The service is available free of charge by periodically filling in
surveys similar to the one presented during registration, and the data
provider has no intention of charging for it in the future.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>If you wish to use Zap2It DataDirect, you'll need to establish a user
account.  Go to 
<A HREF="http://labs.zap2it.com">http://labs.zap2it.com</A> and click on the "New User? Sign Up" link. 
Read the license terms, and if you agree with them click "Accept".  The next
screen is the subscription registration.  In the "Certificate Code" field,
enter <B>ZIYN-DQZO-SBUT</B>.</P>
<P>Fill in the survey, then proceed to the lineup choices and configure your
account for your particular location and the channels that you have.  This

<P>See the section called

</P>
<P>As of MythTV version 0.18, there is no need to edit the
<CODE>settings.pro</CODE> file to set compile-time options.  The
<B>configure</B> script will configure MythTV appropriately for your
system.  If you wish to change options, run <B>./configure --help</B> to
see what is available and to override and automatically detected options. 
See the <CODE>config.log</CODE> file after running <B>configure</B> to see
previous runs.</P>
<P>On a single CPU machine, you would type the following to compile MythTV:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ qmake mythtv.pro
$ make
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you want to build MythTV on a multi-CPU machine (or with
<B>distcc</B>), specify "-j numjobs".  In the following example, we will
have two concurrent jobs executing.  Do not set the number of jobs too high,
or your compile will actually take longer to complete than it would if you
did a "normal" build.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ qmake mythtv.pro
$ make qmake
$ make -j 2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you are using <B>distcc</B>, and you had two other host machines (red, blue)
participating, you would do something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ export DISTCC_HOSTS='localhost red blue'
$ qmake mythtv.pro
$ make qmake
$ make -j 6 CXX=distcc
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The actual speed-up, if any, is dependant on a number of factors, such as
number of CPUs / hosts, etc.  The <B>distcc</B> documentation recommends
using a <CODE>-j</CODE> value of twice the number of CPUs available to keep all
of them busy.</P>
<P>Some timing information.  The following should only be used for
illustration; your actual results may vary.  The test involves a complete
<CODE>make distclean</CODE> to the final binary.
<UL>
<LI>P4 3.2Ghz HT: "standard" make: 12m 49s</LI>
<LI>P4 3.2Ghz HT: make -j 2: 11m 24s </LI>
</UL>

<P>Other than the exclusion of the MySQL server and XMLTV, the MythTV
compilation procedure is the same as when you're setting up both a backend
and a frontend.  However, you <EM>will</EM> need to install the database
access libraries.</P>
<P>Once MythTV is compiled and installed:
<LI>Run the MythTV setup program on your Master backend. Under the "General"
menu, change the IP address of the current machine (by default, "127.0.0.1")
to the real external IP address - 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address and no
external machine can access it. Change the Master Server IP setting to the
same IP address as well.</LI>
<LI>Run the mythfrontend program on your frontend machine,
and a "Database Configuration" screen should appear.
Set the "Host name" field to point to your Master backend's IP address.</LI>

<P>If your video doesn't appear to be in-sync with your audio, it could be
because you are listening to the real-time audio from your video card rather
than after it's been processed and synchronized to the video by MythTV. 
Because MythTV is a personal video recorder, "Live TV" isn't really live -
to let you pause live TV, MythTV is actually encoding the video, saving to
disk, and then playing it back.  This procedure puts your MythTV "live" TV
about 2 seconds behind real-time, so it's important that you're not
listening to the live audio.  However, if you're having an issue where the
audio and video aren't synchronized by small but varying amount, it's most
likely because the sound driver that you're using doesn't have the
DSP_CAP_REALTIME capability.  This was the case with ALSA (0.5), but not
with newer versions (0.9).  See the 
<A HREF="#Troubleshooting_Audio">Troubleshooting Audio</A> section for more information if you're having
issues with sound.  Also, ensure that no other programs are grabbing the
audio output, like <B>arts</B> or <B>esd</B>.</P>
<P>What you need to do is to mute the "line-in" of your sound card and also
set it as the recording source.</P>
<P>There are two ways to do this.  Graphically, and from the command line.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1</A> <A HREF="#toc7.1">Graphically setting up the mixer</A>
</H2>

<H3>Mandrake and Red Hat Linux/Fedora Core</H3>

<P>Open Kmix by clicking K->Multimedia->Sound->Kmix for Mandrake, or
<PRE>
RedHat Menu>Sound &amp; Video>Volume Control
</PRE>
 on Red Hat/Fedora.</P>
<P>Click on Settings->Configure  Make sure that "Tick Marks" and "Show
labels" have "X"'s in them.  This will make it easier to find the correct
audio source.  Click OK.</P>
<P>On the mixer page, look for Line-In on your sound card.  You should see
two LED's - a green one at the top, and a red one at the bottom.  The green
one at the top is for muting; you want to make sure that the green LED is a
dark green, meaning that it's "off".  You also want to click on the red LED
so that it turns bright red, indicating that it's "ON"; this insures that
the Line-in is used as the source.  Click OK, and make sure that you save
the settings so that this is your default.</P>

<H3>Using OSS drivers.</H3>

<P>Red Hat Linux and Fedora Core 1 ship with OSS sound drivers rather than the ALSA
drivers recommended by the MythTV team. The OSS drivers do work for many
people, and for many cards. We recommend that you give OSS a try since it is
already included in the vendor distribution. However, some people report problems (sync
and jitter) with OSS, and in addition it does not support full-duplex on
some cards.  Full duplex is required if you want to record and play sound
using just one sound card. ALSA has good full-duplex support, and also has
drivers for some built-in (motherboard) sound cards that OSS does not.
Installing ALSA is less painful than you might think, so if OSS does not
work for you, installing ALSA is not too difficult. For those of you who do
not wish to install ALSA you must do this:</P>
<P>To configure sound to work with MythTV, select 
<PRE>
RedHat Menu>Sound &amp;
Video>Volume Control
</PRE>
 to open up a mixer. Make sure your global volume
(on the far left) is up. Also make sure that the "line in" section has
"mute" and "record" checked and that the gain is turned up. You may have to
experiment with volume/gain levels to get the best sound.  </P>

<H3>Using ALSA.</H3>

<P>If you'd like to use ALSA, you'll need to correctly setup your
<CODE>asoundrc</CODE> file. Configuring this file is beyond the scope of this
HOWTO.  Once ALSA is working correctly, change the output sound device in
mythfrontend->setup->Audio from <CODE>/dev/dsp</CODE> to <CODE>ALSA:default</CODE>.
This field may be edited to suit your ALSA requirements.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2</A> <A HREF="#toc7.2">Setting the mixer from the command line</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have installed the alsa-utils package, then the <B>amixer</B>
program can be used to setup the mixer.  The "Master" volume setting is only
required on a frontend machine to ensure that the sound channels are unmuted
and configured for outputting sound.  The "Line" and "Capture" controls are
required for your sound card to actually capture audio from the external
Line-in.  Not all sound cards have a "Capture" control, but if yours does
and you don't set it then MythTV will not capture audio.</P>

</P>
<P>If you have multiple sound cards, then use the <CODE>-c</CODE> parameter to
specify which card to adjust.  Note that the first card will be "0", the
second will be "1", etc.</P>
<P>That takes care of setting the volume correctly, and the ALSA startup script
will restore the volume after a reboot.  If you find that your sound is
distorted, it's possible that the levels in the above examples are too high
for your particular hardware combination.  Try reducing the percentages by
5-10% and checking again.  Once you're satisfied, re-run the <CODE>alsactl
store</CODE> command.</P>
<P>You may also use the <B>alsamixer</B> program to set the volume. If you
are using an ALSA version after 1.0.6, use <B>alsamixer -V all</B> . First,
start <B>alsamixer</B> from the command line.  You should start out on the
"Master" volume control slider.  Use the up and down cursor to set the
master volume to around 75%.  Next, use the left and right cursor keys to
move around on the screen until you find the "Line" slider.  Press SPACE to
set it as the capture source, set the level to around 50-75% and press "M"
to mute it.  You can now press ESC to exit out of the <B>alsamixer</B>
program.  You can also have MythTV manage all volume and mute settings, but
this will only affect the "Master" or PCM volume, not the capture volume.  See
the mythfrontend setup page for options.</P>

You're going to need to know what sort of receiver you have and where it's
connected.  In the case of the Pinnacle Studio TV card, with the IR receiver
connected to COM1 (/dev/ttys0), once the configuration menu comes up,
perform the configuration by going to Driver Configuration->Other Serial
Port Devices->Pinnacle Systems Receiver->OK and on the next page select
COM1->OK.</P>
<P>Each remote is different; some remote receivers connect directly to your
capture card and not to a serial port, so make sure that you've got the
correct one.</P>
<P>You then click "Save Configuration and run configure" to continue.</P>
<P>Make sure you read the last text generated by the configure step. It will
tell you if you require a kernel recompile, and what the name of your kernel
module will be (if necessary). For instance a home-built receiver may
require a kernel recompile, so you would be notified that you will have to
load the lirc_serial module. If you did not get any such messages skip the
kernel recompile steps below and go directly to making and installing the
lirc driver.</P>

<P>As you can see, there's a link from /dev/lirc to ttyS0, a.k.a. "COM1", which is

Some IR receivers (including some homebrew units) use a character device as
their data interface as opposed to a link to a serial port.  If the <CODE>make
install</CODE> step has created a character device for you, don't replace it
with a link to a COM port.</P>
<P>So, if the link or character device was not created (but should have been),
ensure that you ran the <CODE>make install</CODE> step as root.  If it still
doesn't work, then there are three options.  The first option is to re-read
the <B>lirc</B> documentation to determine whether your IR receiver is a
character device or should be a link to a serial port and to create the
link/character device manually.  In this example, the IR device is connected
to ttyS0.  If it were connected to "COM2", then use ttyS1, etc.

<P>Take a look at the lircrc.example files in the <CODE>configfiles/</CODE>

which took care of basic functionality.  Because the PCTV Studio remote
has additional buttons, look at the
<CODE>configfiles/lircrc.example.pinnaclestudiopctv</CODE> for an example of how
to define additional buttons, and how to debug potential button name

<P>By examining the button names defined in <CODE>/etc/lircd.conf</CODE> and using
the <B>irw</B> program to make sure that your remote is working, you can
create the appropriate mappings in <CODE>.lircrc</CODE> to get excellent remote
functionality with MythTV.</P>
<P>Note the <B>repeat =</B> parameter.  This informs the <CODE>irxevent</CODE>
program to pass through every third keypress.  By default, <CODE>lirc</CODE>
will only send one keypress to the application, even if you're holding down
the key.  The actual <B>repeat =</B> number will vary from system to

<P>This csh script will be called each time MythTV needs to change the channel.
Below is a copy of the script followed by the corresponding perl script.
Make sure both are in your path. Also make sure you leave the #!/bin/csh

<P>Open a shell and decide where you will store your video files.  By
default, MythTV will assume that you will be using <CODE>/mnt/store/</CODE>, but
if this directory doesn't exist, or it exists and you don't have write
privileges to it then MythTV will fail when you attempt to make a recording. 
The following example is specific for <CODE>/var/video</CODE>, but the same
instructions would apply if you want to keep the default but don't have the
directory structure setup yet.  See the 
<A HREF="#advancedpartitionformatting">Advanced Partition Formatting</A> section for hints on creating a

<P>The first thing to configure is the Master backend system.  If you are
running multiple backend systems, the Master backend will make all
decisions about which programs will be recorded on which tuners.  If you
have only one backend, then it will be its own master.</P>
<P>The Master backend will always choose the first available tuner in the same
order as you add cards through "setup". In other words, the second card you
add will only be used when there are two overlapping recordings, the third
when there are three, and so on. Therefore, you will want to have the
greatest amount of disk space on the Master backend because its tuner will
always be the first choice. You will then want to add your 
<A HREF="#nonmaster_backend">other backends</A> in the order of your
preference for recording.</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="warning.eps">
<IMG SRC="warning.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  It is possible to <EM>not</EM> have the cards on the Master

</P>
<P>The backend setup program will start and offer you a number of choices.  It
is <EM>strongly</EM> recommended that you go through them in order.</P>
<P>The first question will ask if you wish to clear out your existing
configurations for your capture cards.  Initially, you should say "YES" so
that there are no surprises later.</P>
<P>The next question will ask you if you wish to clear out your video source
information.  You should answer "YES" to this as well.</P>
<P>Once the graphical setup starts, you'll see that there are five choices.
<OL>
<LI>General</LI>
<LI>Capture Cards</LI>
<LI>Video Sources</LI>
<LI>Input Connections</LI>
<LI>Channel Editor</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Use the arrow keys to move around, and press the space bar to select which
option you wish to configure.</P>

<H3>General</H3>

<P>The first screen of the General configuration deals with IP addresses of the
system that you're running setup on and any master backend you may have.  If
you've only got one machine, then the default values are fine and you can
move to the next page by pressing the space bar.  If you need to move around
the screen, use the arrow keys to move focus between settings, not the
mouse.</P>
<P>If you will be deploying multiple backends, or if your backend is on one
system and you're running the frontend on another machine then <EM>do
not</EM> use the "127.0.0.1" IP address.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: If you modify the 127.0.0.1 address and use a "real" IP
address, you must use real IP addresses in both fields, otherwise your
frontend machines will generate "Unexpected response to MYTH_PROTO_VERSION"
errors.</P>
<P>It is very strongly discouraged that you make any changes to the port
settings from the defaults.</P>
<P>Once you're satisfied with the values, move the focus down to Next and hit
the space bar.</P>
<P>The next screen details the Host-specific Backend setup.  This is where you
will set the specific directory paths for this particular backend.  Make
sure that you've followed the steps at the beginning of this section and
created a directory that exists and that MythTV will have write privileges
to.  When you're done, press Next to continue, taking you to the Global
Backend Setup.</P>
<P>On the Global Backend Setup configure your backend with the appropriate
settings.  Use the left and right arrow keys to iterate through the choices
available on each setting, and the up and down keys to move between
settings.  Move to Finish when you're done and press the space bar, taking
you back to the main configuration screen.</P>

<H3>Capture Cards</H3>

<P>You should have no capture cards defined, so the highlight will be on
(New Capture Card).  Press space to begin.</P>
<P>Choose the appropriate settings for your particular tuner.  Use the arrow
keys to move around and to make your choices, and press RETURN when
complete.  Pressing RETURN will take you back to the Capture Cards screen;
if you have additional capture cards in this machine, press the space bar
when the highlight is on the (New Capture Card) row to define another card. </P>
<P>If you have made a mistake, you can delete a card by highlighting it and 
pressing the 'D' key, or you can highlight it and press the RETURN or 'E'
key to edit it.</P>
<P>Once you have no additional cards to setup, press ESC.</P>

<H3><A NAME="VideoSources"></A> Video Sources </H3>

<P>When you start, the highlight should be on (New Video Source).  Press the
space bar to begin.  The first field asks for the name of the video source.
You may choose something easy to remember, like "Antenna" or "Cable".  Once
you've chosen a name, press the down arrow to move to the next field.  </P>
<P>If you're in North America, change the grabber to "DataDirect", then
continue pressing the down arrow to move to the next field.  Fill in the
username and password that you have established with DataDirect, then move
to the "Retrieve Listings" button and press the space bar.  </P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: You need <B>wget</B> version 1.9.1 or higher to use
DataDirect.</P>
<P>The setup program will contact the Zap2It servers and get your account
information.  Once you're done, you may click the Finish button and skip the
next few paragraphs in this document since they only apply to users that are
using the external XMLTV script to get their guide data.</P>
<P>If you wish to continue using the XMLTV grabber, then move to the Zip/postal
code field and put in the appropriate value.</P>
<P>If you're outside of North America, then some manual interaction will be
required with XMLTV.</P>
<P>Once you have chosen your provider, press RETURN to continue.  XMLTV will
now begin collecting the initial data for your location.  The screen may
blank for a few seconds to several minutes, depending on the load of the
listings provider and the speed of your connection to the Internet.  Be
patient!</P>
<P>You will then be returned to the Video Sources screen.  If you have multiple
video sources available, such as Antenna, Cable, etc, go ahead and define
them all, even if they're not all going to be physically connected to the
master backend server.  Once you're done, press ESC to return to the main
screen.</P>

<H3>Input Connections</H3>

<P>The final configuration item is Input Connections.  On this screen, you
will associate the various video sources you defined earlier with a physical
input to a encoder card.  It's entirely possible that you have multiple
tuners, and each tuner has a different input, so on this screen you let
MythTV know which device will connect to which input source.</P>
<P>When you start this screen, you should see a listing of the various input
connections available on each of the Capture cards you defined earlier.  For
example, you may have a capture card with a tuner, a SVideo and a Composite
connection.  If you wanted to associate the tuner (a.k.a., "Television")
with an "Antenna" source you defined in Video Sources, you would move to the
<CODE>/dev/videodevice (Television) -> </CODE> line and press the space bar. 
Using the left and right arrow keys will show you the various choices you
have already created for video source.  In our case, you would use the
left/right cursor keys until "Antenna" was shown in the Video Source field. 
Press down to move to the next setting, all of which should be
self-explanatory.</P>
<P>If you have multiple input connection types (Such as Tuner 0 and Tuner 1),
it's very, very likely that it is the lowest numbered input that is actually
available on the device.</P>

<CODE>/dev/video1</CODE>.  Each <CODE>/dev/video</CODE> device will have a Tuner 0
and Tuner 1 input, so you would choose Tuner 0 for <B>both</B> devices.</CAPTION>

<P>Once you're done, press RETURN to go back to the Input Connections screen.

</FIGURE>
</P>
<P>Press ESC to return to the main menu, and press ESC again if you have no
further items to configure, thereby returning you to the command line.</P>

<H3>Channel Editor</H3>

<P>The channel editor is used to globally alter channel information,
including items like hue, contrast, fine tuning and others.  Users in North
America shouldn't run the channel editor until after completing initial
setup and running <B>mythfilldatabase</B> at least once to populate the

setup.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: If you are using DataDirect and watching the output messages
on the console or the log file it is normal to see a "401 Unauthorized"
error followed by a "200 OK" when the connection to Zap2It is being

<H2><A NAME="deinterlace_"></A> <A NAME="ss10.4">10.4</A> <A HREF="#toc10.4">Playback </A>
 </H2>

<P>The one configuration item which may cause problems on your system is the
"Deinterlace playback" setting.  MythTV uses a linear blend algorithm for
deinterlacing, which will improve how the image looks on your screen. 
Deinterlacing requires that your processor support SSE. (Streaming SIMD
Extensions, aka "MMX2").  Early Intel Celeron (those that don't use the
Coppermine 0.18um core and are usually &lt;600MHz), Pentium Pro and Pentium II
CPUs do not have SSE, so make sure that you haven't enabled deinterlacing if
your processor doesn't support it. If you enable it, and your processor
doesn't support SSE, you will get "Illegal Instruction" errors.</P>
<P>To determine if you've got SSE on an Intel processor, you can:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo
[snip]
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca
cmov pat pse36 mmx fxsr sse
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Notice the <B>sse</B> at the end of the line - this tells you that this
processor will be able to deinterlace correctly.</P>
<P>On an AMD processor, look for "3dnow" in the cpuinfo line; "3dnow" is AMD's
implementation of SSE instructions, so if your processor has 3dnow you
shouldn't have any issues with deinterlacing.</P>
<H3>Video Filters</H3>

<P>MythTV provides a facility to include video filters while recording and
during playback. These filters can be used to improve or modify the video
image, including hiding the effects of an interlaced image or reducing the
effects of noise in a poor video signal. The following is a brief
introduction to introduce you to the filters that are available in MythTV
version 0.18.1.</P>
<H3>Applying filters</H3>

<P>One or more filters can be included in a "filter chain". The filters to
be used are identified in a "filter string". A filter string is a group of
filter names and parameters separated by commas.  To include parameters, the
filter name is followed by "=" and the parameter information. There should
be no spaces in the filter string. Here is an example filter string:</P>
<P>With parameters: <CODE>kerneldeint=10:1,denoise3d=12</CODE></P>
<P>Without: <CODE>kerneldeint,denoise3d</CODE></P>
<P>Recording filters are set for each individual channel. These may be used
when encoding in software (MPEG-4, RTjpeg) but do not apply when using a
capture card with hardware encoding such as those supported by the ivtv
driver, DVB, HDTV or MJPEG cards. You can run MythTV's "setup" program and
select the "Channel Editor". On the first page for each channel, you can
enter a filter string in the box titled "Video filters". If you are running
"mythweb" on your web server, you can click on "Settings" then "Channels"
and enter filter strings in the "videofilters" column.</P>
<P>Playback filters are per-host and apply to any recording you watch from the
frontend where filters have been applied. Playback filtering can only
work with software decoding so the viaslice, xvmc, and ivtv outputs ignore
filters entirely. From "mythfrontend" go to Setup->TV Settings->Playback.
Enter your filter string in the box titled "Custom Filters".</P>

<H3>Currently Available Filters</H3>

<P>"Deinterlace Playback" checkbox.</P>
<P>This implements special behavior needed for the "bobdeint" filter but can
also be used to choose any of the deinterlace filters. If you prefer, you
may leave this unchecked and include any of the deinterlace filters, other
than "bobdeint", in your custom filter chain.</P>

<P>o  The "invert" filter</P>
<P>Invert ignores any parameters and inverts the pixel values of the video
frames.  In other words, a negative image. This would rarely be useful but
may be a good example to verify that your filter strings take effect.</P>
<P>o  The "linearblend" filter</P>
<P>It is a simple deinterlacing filter that ignores parameters and works by
blending adjacent lines.  It replaces combing in interlaced video with a
less distracting "ghost" image.</P>
<P>o The "bobdeint" filter</P>
<P>This filter splits the interlaced image into two separate fields that
can be line doubled then displayed at twice the frame rate. If the
display is at the same refresh rate as the recording (59.92Hz NTSC or
50Hz PAL) this will cause each refresh to show objects in motion in
a new position with no jagged edges. However, if the display is not
synchronous, it will cause flickering or the appearance of the picture
moving up and down by one line.</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="stop.eps">
<IMG SRC="stop.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>: This filter requires the frame rate to be doubled
and therefore can only be used with the "Deinterlace Playback" checkbox.
Do not include this in your filter chain.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>
</P>
<P>o  The "kerneldeint" filter</P>
<P>Kerneldeint is a more complex deinterlacing filter which applies a filter
kernel using input from several lines.  It generally removes combing without
a "ghost" image, sometimes leaving a faint outline of the image from the
other field. It is considered to be less distracting to watch than
linearblend or no filter at all. It accepts one or two integer parameters
separated by a colon.</P>
<P>The first parameter is the filter threshold and defaults to 12. Adjacent
lines differing by more than the threshold value are filtered. The second
option defaults to 0.  If set to a non-zero value, it will cause the filter
to skip chroma, and filter only the luminance.  It may be useful on some
capture cards which do not capture the chroma fields of interlaced video
correctly.</P>
<P>o The "onefield" filter</P>
<P>This is a simple one-field deinterlacing filter that uses only one field of
the interlaced video.  By default it keeps the top field, though passing the
parameter "bottom" will cause it to keep the bottom field instead.</P>
<P>This filter is primarily useful for those who display 1080i HDTV signals
with a video mode that has 540 pixels vertically.  The advantage over other
deinterlacing filters is that scenes with motion never show combing or
ghosting.</P>
<P>o The "adjust" filter</P>
<P>This filter adjusts the digital values for luma and chroma to ensure that
they will fall within the ranges specified in the ITU-R601 standard. By
default, this corrects a known problem for the luma range used by bt8x8
chips which causes video to look washed out. If parameters are passed, there
need to be exactly six. However, passing a single parameter of "-1" will
disable the filter.</P>
<P>1: luma minimum input value (int)
2: luma maximum input value (int)
3: luma gamma correction (float)
4: chroma minimum input value (int)
5: chroma maximum input value (int)
6: chroma gamma correction (float)</P>
<P>The default bt8x8 correction values are equivalent to
"16:253:1.0:2:253:1.0".  Output ranges are fixed at ITU-R601 values (16-235
luma, 16-240 chroma).</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: If it is not already specified in the filter chain, this
filter will be automatically applied when recording with the "bttv" driver.</P>
<P>o  The "quickdnr" filter</P>
<P>A fast temporal denoiser. This can take 1, 2 or 4 parameters, each being a
value from "0" for the least filtering to "255" for the greatest filtering.
With one parameter, the filter will compute the values it should use for all
of its variables. Two parameters will set the filter strength for luma and
chroma independently. If you are interested in how the algorithm works, you
may examine the source code to see how four parameter are used.</P>
<P>o  The "denoise3d" filter</P>
<P>A slower denoiser that applies a spatial and temporal low-pass filter. The
spatial filter can remove some noise that quickdnr can't, but a more
powerful CPU is needed.  This filter accepts 3 float parameters:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>luma spatial filter strength</LI>
<LI>chroma spatial filter strength</LI>
<LI>luma temporal filter strength</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Reasonable defaults will be selected for omitted parameters.  The chroma
temporal filter strength is calculated from the other filter strengths.</P>
<P>o  The "crop" filter</P>
<P>Covers edges of video with black bars.  This helps improve video quality
when the edges of the frame are distorted. By default, this removes 16
pixels from each edge. This can optionally take four parameters representing
top:left:bottom:right. The number times 16 is the number of pixels to remove
so, for example, the default is "=1:1:1:1".</P>
<P>o  The "forceyv12" and "forceyuv422p" filters</P>
<P>These force the filter manager to use the given format.  You can use one of
these at the head of a filter chain to change the capture format. The most
likely use would be forceyuv422p to use YUV422P capture on cards with known
chroma interlacing problems with YV12.</P>
<P>There are some filters included in the MythTV source code that should 
not be used:</P>
<P>o  The "forcergb24" and "forceargb32" filters</P>
<P>The two RGB formats should not be used because there is no conversion filter
for them yet.</P>
<P>o  The "convert" filter</P>
<P>It exists but don't use it.  The filter manager uses this filter
automatically when it is unable to match the input/output formats of two
adjacent filters.</P>
<P>o  The "postprocess" filter</P>
<P>While this exists in MythTV source code, it is currently not recommended for
use.</P>

<H3>Usage Considerations</H3>

<P>There are trade-offs to consider when deciding if it would be wise to use
a filter. Any processing will modify the original image so you should assess
if the filter has made a noticeable improvement to the picture in order to
justify the impact of the processing.  Adding any filter will inherently
increase CPU usage. The impact can vary dramatically depending on your CPU
type and speed, the resolution of the recording, which filters you are using
and other factors. You can only determine what is right for you through
experimentation. However, as a starting point, here are some filter strings
that you may find useful:</P>
<P>For typical broadcast stations:      "kerneldeint,quickdnr"</P>
<P>For stations with poor signal quality: "linearblend,denoise3d=12"</P>
<P>For synchronous TV-out: check Deinterlace with "Bob (2x framerate)"</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss10.5">10.5</A> <A HREF="#toc10.5">Recording </A>
</H2>

<P>Depending on your capture card, MythTV offers different video encoders. 
The following types of hardware encoding cards are supported:
<UL>
<LI>MJPEG - Zoran-based cards; see 
<A HREF="http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net">http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net</A></LI>
<LI>MPEG-2 - iTVC15/16 based cards (Hauppauge PVR-250/PVR-350); see 
<A HREF="http://ivtv.sourceforge.net">http://ivtv.sourceforge.net</A> </LI>
<LI>HDTV - pcHDTV cards; see 
<A HREF="http://pchdtv.com">http://pchdtv.com</A> and
the Air2PC-ATSC-PCI see 
<A HREF="http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=103">http://www.cyberestore.com/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=103</A></LI>
<LI>DVB - cards supporting DVB; see 
<A HREF="http://linuxtv.org">http://linuxtv.org</A></LI>
</UL>

For cards without hardware encoding capabilities (all cards supported by
V4L not listed above), Myth includes two methods for software encoding:
RTjpeg and MPEG-4.  RTjpeg has significantly fewer CPU demands than MPEG-4,
but it generates larger files than MPEG-4 for a given recording.</P>
<P>For DVB and HDTV cards, no further configuration is required after
setting up the card using the 'setup' program.
For all other cards, configuration is done through MythFrontend. 
Selecting 'Recording Profiles' from the 'TV Settings' screen will list
the profiles currently available for the cards in your system. 
Depending on what types of cards you have installed you may see:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
(Create new profile group)
Software Encoders
Hardware MPEG Encoders
Hardware MJPEG Encoders
Transcoders
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The '(Create new profile group)' option will allow you to create custom
profiles in case you have multiple backends.  Note that custom profiles
are per backend and card type.  If you have 2 MPEG-2 encoders in a given
backend system, creating a custom profile will affect both of them.  This
option should not be needed otherwise.</P>
<P>The 'Transcoders' group is a little different from the others.  Selecting
this group will result in a menu with the following options: 'RTjpeg/MPEG-4'
and 'MPEG-2'.  These types indicate what transcoder options will be used for
a given input type (i.e. the 'MPEG-2' settings would be used to transcode
MPEG-2 files into MPEG-4.  The source of the MPEG-2 stream (DVB, HDTV, or
PVR-x50) does not matter. Configuration of the options is the same as below
(although any resolution settings will be ignored).</P>
<P>Selecting any of the other options will show a new screen with a list of
four profiles:
<UL>
<LI>Default</LI>
<LI>Live TV</LI>
<LI>Low Quality</LI>
<LI>High Quality</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The Default profile will be used for any recording which does not otherwise
have a specific profile assigned. The 'Live TV' profile will be used when
watching TV.  The remaining two profiles are available for customizing to
allow for more precise control over what quality is used for a given
program.</P>
<P>Selecting a profile will allow you to adjust the relevant options for that
card.  The most significant setting is the recording resolution, but you can
also choose encoding format, audio format, and tweak other encoder specific
properties.</P>

anything, if you start MythTV and don't see video or you get "segmentation

<H2><A NAME="ss10.6">10.6</A> <A HREF="#toc10.6">Xbox Frontends</A>
</H2>

<P>MythTV is able to control the LED on the Xbox to indicate backend
recording status.  </P>
<P>To control the LED, you will need the <B>blink</B> program from the
xbox-linux project, which is installed as <CODE>/bin/led</CODE> on GentooX.  On
Xebian (the new Ed's Debian) you must install it yourself.  On other
distributions it may or may not be installed as a program called
<B>blink</B> and should be located in your path.  (Type <CODE>which
blink</CODE> to see if the program is available.) If you do not have
<B>blink</B>, you may obtain it from the Xbox-Linux project site at 
<A HREF="http://xbox-linux.sf.net/">http://xbox-linux.sf.net/</A>. The
program you need is part of the <CODE>eds_i2c_staff</CODE> module in CVS.  Note
the spelling.</P>
<P>Once you have installed <B>blink</B> you will need to set permissions. 
<B>blink</B> needs write permission to the i2c device to function
properly.  There are three methods to accomplish this.  First, you could run
<CODE>mythfrontend</CODE> as root, which is the simplest method, but could
potentially be a security risk.  Next, you may make the <B>blink</B>
binary setuid root, which allows non-privileged users to run a program with
root capability.  This is done by typing the command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ su
# chmod u+s /path/to/blink
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The final technique would be to set the <CODE>/dev/i2c/0</CODE> device read/write
for all users, but this is the least preferred method.</P>
<P>Now it's time to setup MythTV for Xbox hardware.  Enter Setup -> General. 
On the second page check the 'Enable Xbox Hardware' option.  Upon reentering
the settings, you should have a new option named 'Xbox'.  Within this option
you may select the distribution, LED colors for recording and the update
interval.  If you select GentooX as the distribution <B>led</B> will be
used as the <B>blink</B> binary name, otherwise, <B>blink</B> is used. 
Colors should be self explanatory.  The update interval determines how often
the frontend should poll the backend to determine if the status has changed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.6">11.6</A> <A HREF="#toc11.6">Using Shutdown/Wakeup</A>
</H2>

<P>What does the MythTV Shutdown/Wakeup function do? The scheduler on the
Master backend (MBE) keeps track of the idle status of the entire MythTV
system, including the Slave backends (SBE). If it considers the system to be
idle, and thus ready to shutdown, it sets the wakeuptime to the time of the
next recording and then proceeds to shut down all Slave backends and then
itself. Once it is time to begin recording, the Master backend and the Slave
Backends are automatically woken up.  This system allows MythTV to record
like a normal VCR, thereby conserving power when not in active use.</P>
<P>In order to use the Shutdown/Wakeup function there must be some method of
waking up the Master backend.  There are any number of solutions, but we
will discuss in detail two possibilities:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Use another server that runs 24/7 and have it send a WakeOnLAN (WOL)
packet to wake the Master backend.  This assumes that you have the WOL tools
installed, and that your Master backend motherboard supports WOL.</LI>
<LI>Use your motherboard's BIOS wakeup capability.  You'll need a motherboard
that supports BIOS wakeup, and some tools.  Two that work are: 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nvram-wakeup">http://sourceforge.net/projects/nvram-wakeup</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.malloc.de/tools/wakeup_clock.html">http://www.malloc.de/tools/wakeup_clock.html</A></LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>A deeper look into the operation</H3>

<P>The scheduler keeps track of the idle status of the MythTV system. To
determine whether or not the MythTV system is idle, the following conditions
must be met for a period of time defined in the "Idle timeout (secs)"
parameter.
<UL>
<LI>no client is connected to the server</LI>
<LI>no recording (neither LiveTV nor a regular recording) is currently taking place</LI>
<LI>no recording starts within a definable amount of time ("Max. wait for recording (min)")</LI>
<LI>the "pre Shutdown check-command" returns 0 </LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>If we get to this idle state the Master backend will set the wakeuptime using the "Set
wakeuptime command", which is the same for WOL and BIOS wakeup. The Master backend will
then shut down the Slave backends and itself using the "Server halt command".</P>
<P>One caveat is that the scheduler tries to guess if the Master backend was started by a
wakeup call or by the user. If it thinks it was woken up by a user, it
blocks shutdown until a client connects to the Master backend, after which it will
behave as described above. To disable this feature, unset "Block shutdown
before client connected" in the mythfrontend Setup->Setup->General screen.</P>
<P>Once it is time to startup the system, the Master backend is woken up first and will
wakeup the Slave backends using the "Wake command for slaves". At this time, there is
no support for starting only the required Slave backend, so all Slave backends will startup.</P>

<H3>Setting up the MythTV side of this extension.</H3>

<P>There are a number of options that are used to control the Shutdown /
Wakeup feature.</P>
<P>Shutdown/Wakeup Options:
<UL>
<LI>"Idle timeout (secs)" is the time the server waits while idle until a
shutdown occurs.</LI>
<LI>"Max. wait for recording (min)" is the time the Master backend waits for a recording
without shutting down. For example, this would be used to prevent a 10
minute system shutdown if a recording is set to start 15 minutes from now.</LI>
<LI>"Startup before rec. (secs)" Sets how long before a programmed
recording the MythTV system will be woken up.  This should be roughly be the
time your systems need to bootup, and if you have Slave backends, you'll
need to ensure this value is long enough for all your machines to perform
their bootup cycle.</LI>
<LI>"Wakeup time format" is the format of the wakeup time that is given in
the "Set wakeuptime command" as a parameter "$time". You need to set this
according to your wakeup mechanism. If you need seconds since the epoch
(1970-01-01) set the "Wakeup time format" to "time_t".</LI>
<LI>"Set wakeuptime command" is the command executed to set the new wakeuptime. </LI>
<LI>"Server Halt Command" is the command executed to shutdown the Master
backend and the Slave backends.</LI>
<LI>"pre Shutdown check-command" is an optional command used to give a
"Go/NO-GO" decision from a non-MythTV source.  This command is executed
immediately before the shutdown would occur. The return value is use to make
the following choices:
<UL>
<LI>If it returns a "0" the shutdown will occur as scheduled.</LI>
<LI>If it returns a "1" the "idle timeout" will be reset and the system
waits again for the timeout.</LI>
<LI>If it returns a "2" the entire shutdown sequence is reset.  This means
that a new client connect is needed before a shutdown occurs, unless you have
the "Wait for client connect" setting disabled, in which case this is the same as
returning "1".  An example of a use for this return value is to prevent the shutdown
if a user is currently logged in, or if a specific program (i.e. transcode,
automatic updates, etc.) is currently running. If you don't need it, leave
the field blank.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The "WakeOnLan settings":
These settings have nothing to do with using BIOS or WOL wakeup, they are
the same for both.
<UL>
<LI>"Master backend" This setting defines timings for the frontends to
wakeup the Master backend using WOL. Useful if your frontend can emit a WOL
packet so you don't need to physically go to the Master backend if you're
trying to watch TV.</LI>
<LI>"Reconnect wait time (secs)" is the time the frontend waits after
executing the "Wake command" before attempting to retry the connection. This
should be roughly the amount of time your Master backend needs for bootup.
Set to "0" to disable. The frontends will retry to connect for "Count of
reconnect tries" times before giving up.</LI>
<LI>"Wake command for slaves" is the <EM>one</EM> command executed to wake
your Slave backends. This should be a script that contains the calls to
wakeup all Slave backend systems.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Using WOL to wake your Master backend. </H3>

<P>To use WOL to wake your Master backend you will need a WOL capable Master
backend, a machine that runs 24/7 which can execute an at-job and nc (netcat)
on the Master backend. I use some little bash scripts to make my DSL router
wakeup my mythbox if required.</P>
<P>Replace $SERVER and $PORT with your own settings!
On my Master backend I have a script that gets called as 'setwakeuptime command' which
looks like the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#! /bin/sh
echo $@ | nc $SERVER $PORT
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This simply cats the parameters (that is $time) to my 24/7 server. On my
$SERVER I have (x)inetd listening on $PORT starting a little script which
cares about setting the at-job. The following additions are necessary on the
$SERVER:</P>
<P>If you use <B>inetd</B>:</P>
<P>In <CODE>/etc/inetd.conf</CODE> add:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mythwake stream tcp nowait mythtv /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/local/bin/mythwake
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If you use <B>xinetd</B>, save the following as <B>mythwake</B> in your
<CODE>/etc/xinet.d/</CODE> directory:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
service mythwake
  {    
        socket_type     = stream
        wait            = no
        user            = mythtv        
        protocol        = tcp
        id              = mythwake
        server          = /usr/local/bin/mythwake
  }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and add the following to <CODE>/etc/services</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
mythwake        $PORT/tcp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Finally, <CODE>/usr/local/bin/mythwake</CODE> looks like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#! /bin/bash
#this should be a command to wake your server
WAKECMD="#!/bin/sh\n /usr/local/bin/wakeMBE"
#first we need to delete all wake jobs in queue
for JOB in atq | cut -f 1 ; do
    atrm $JOB;
done
#now we read the date from 'nc'
read date;
#now set the atjob
echo -e "$WAKECMD" | at $date ;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>SECURITY WARNING</B>:
Be sure to secure $SERVER:$PORT from untrusted networks, because this
allows 3rd parties to run arbitrary code on your server!</P>

<H3>Using BIOS wakeup to wake your Master backend.</H3>

<P>Since I don't use this, I cannot say much about this. If your motherboard
supports any wakeup tool you have to call that tool as "Set wakeuptime
command" with the "Wakeup time format" suitable for that tool.</P>
<H3>Wakeup the MySQL server using WOL</H3>

<P>If your MySQL server and your Master backend are not on the same machine,
you can have the Master backend wake your MySQL server using WOL. You will
find the settings for this in the second page of the setup program,
or at the end of mysql.txt.  The meanings are the same as
discussed in "The WakeOnLan settings" above.</P>

<H3>Tips/Tricks:</H3>

<P>If, for example, one of the Slave backends is also your desktop computer,
you could simply use a little script as 'server halt command' which first
calls <CODE>/sbin/shutdown -t TIMEOUT</CODE> where TIMEOUT is a value sufficient
for you to react.  You could then popup a window using *dialog, asking for
permission to shutdown. If you cancel the shutdown, simply call
<CODE>/sbin/shutdown -c</CODE>.</P>
<P>If you get "nvram-wakeup: /dev/rtc: Device or resource busy" your
set-wakeuptime-script should stop the program that uses <CODE>/dev/rtc</CODE> before
setting the wakeuptime.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.7">11.7</A> <A HREF="#toc11.7">Scheduling Recordings</A>
</H2>

<P>The MythTV master backend is responsible for managing the schedule
for all TV tuner cards on the master and any slave. It's job is to
search the TV listing for the shows you have requested and assign
recordings to the TV tuner cards. If none of the shows that you've
chosen overlap, it simply records all of the shows. However, if
there are shows where the beginning and end times overlap, the
scheduler follows rules that you've specified or makes logical
decisions about what would be best if you haven't express your
preference. Further, the "Upcoming Recordings" page allows you make
specific decisions about what you really do and don't want to
record.</P>

<H3>Record Types</H3>

<P>When you choose a show that you would like to record from the
Options Page, there are eight different types of rules to help the
scheduler find which showings you would like to record.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Single Record -- record only this title at this specific
time. This is the best way to be sure that a certain showing is
recorded. However, if the TV listings change and the show is not
broadcast at that time, the show will not be recorded.
</LI>
<LI>Find One -- this will record a title once from any of the times
that appear in the TV listings. This is useful for recording a movie
or special that has multiple showings because it allows the scheduler
to choose one that doesn't conflict. It is not a good choice for
recording a single episode of a series because it records the first
available showing of the title without regard to the episode
information.
</LI>
<LI>Record Weekly -- this records a show whenever the title is listed
on the same channel, weekday and time. Note that if the TV station
changes the schedule for a special episode, it would not be
recorded. However, you can add a Single record for the special
episode.
</LI>
<LI>Find Weekly -- this will record a title once per week from any
of the times that appear in the TV listings beginning from the time of
the showing that was selected when the rule was set. This is useful
for news, current events or other programs where the same episode is
shown several times each week but the listings may not include
descriptive information. This is not a good choice if there are
different episodes shown during the week.
</LI>
<LI>Record Daily -- this records a show whenever the title is listed
for the time and channel on any day of the week. Here again, a show
will not be recorded if the time was altered by the station.
</LI>
<LI>Find Daily -- this will record a title once per day from any
of the times that appear in the TV listings beginning from the time of
the showing that was selected when the rule was set. This is useful
for news, current events or other programs where the same episode is
shown several times each day but the listings may not include
descriptive information. This is not a good choice if there are
different episodes shown during the day.
</LI>
<LI>Channel Record -- records a show anytime the title is listed on
this channel.  This is perhaps the most common rule to use for most
shows.
</LI>
<LI>Record All -- record this title on any channel at any time. This
can be useful if a station has sister stations where shows are
rebroadcast allowing the scheduler to record rebroadcasts on the other
station when the original airing cannot be recorded.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Duplicates</H3>

<P>Singles will record without regard to duplicate matching.</P>

<P>The standard recurring methods of All, Channel, Weekly and Daily use
the descriptive information in the TV listings to try to record only one
showing of each unique episode. However, This goal is sometimes
complicated by the fact that the stations may not include a description
for a specific episode but use a generic description for the series
instead. When there is a generic description, the default behavior is to
assume that it may be an episode that you have not seen and to record it
for you.  One of the duplicate matching options is "Record new episodes
only".  If this is selected, listing that have an original air date of
more than 14 days earlier are considered repeats and are not eligible to
record. Generally, generic episodes will be marked as repeats also.</P>

<P>Because of generic episodes and other situations, MythTV offers an
alternative approach where shows may be recorded by choosing from
multiple showings even when the descriptive information is not reliable.
All of the "Find" record types look for matching titles in the
listings. If there is a showing with specific episode information and
that episode has recorded before, that showing is marked as previously
or currently recorded. The scheduler will then choose to record the
earliest non-conflicting showing from any of other remaining showings
regardless of the descriptive information. Generally, Find One is most
useful for movies or specials and the Find Daily and Find Weekly rules
are best for news or current events shows that are repeated. However,
these may be useful in other situations where the standard recording
rules may not work correctly.</P>

<H3>Conflicts</H3>

<P>As you add more shows that you would like to record, the scheduler
will eventually encounter conflicts. If there are two shows at the
same time and you have two or more TV tuner cards, both shows will
record. However, if there are more shows than cards, the scheduler
will have to decide what it thinks it should not record based on the
information you have given. If you see an unexpected situation you
are not "stuck" with the scheduler's choice. You can still tell the
scheduler exactly which shows you do want to record and/or don't
want to record in any situation.</P>

<H3>Priority</H3>

<P>By default, all shows you select are have equal value to the
scheduler.  There are a set of rules to make good choices when
two or more shows are in conflict. However, priority values let the
scheduler know what you want so that it can set the schedule based
on your preferences.</P>
<P>Initially all priority values are set to zero. You may choose to
leave everything at "0" and let the scheduler follow rules to guess
what you might prefer when there are conflicts. However, if you have
one or two favorite shows, you may want to increase the priority
value so the scheduler will know that you would prefer recording
these over other shows. You might use certain values to rate shows
so that all favorites are 2. good shows are 1 and extra 'filler'
shows are all -1 for example. You could sort each title on the "Set
Priorities" to have a unique value so the scheduler can always know
which show you'd prefer verses any other show. The choice and style
are entirely up to you. However, the more information you give to
the scheduler, the more likely it will make the choices you would
like in the first place.</P>
<P>The scheduler choices are based on the total priority for a showing
by adding up four different priority factors. By default, all of
these factors are "0" but you may use any combination to express
your likes and needs.</P>
<P>Per record rule -- this is the "priority" field in the "Scheduling
Options" section of the options page and this values is included for
any showings that match the recording rule.  You may choose to only
use these values and not use the other factors for the sake of
simplicity and clarity.</P>
<P>Per record type -- Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->General
allows you to add to the priority based on the type. It may make
sense to increase the value for "Single" so that by default they
have an extra advantage over other shows. You may want to decrease
the value for Find rules so that they will be less likely to interfere
with regular shows and will be more likely to record in a
non-conflicting time instead.</P>
<P>Per channel -- Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->Channel
Priorities can be useful if you believe that you prefer any of the
shows on certain channels. This would give all shows on a channel an
advantage by default.</P>
<P>Input preference -- in the MythTV "setup" program, the "Input
Connections" section allows you to add additional priority in the
"Input preference". This is simply another priority factor but has an
interesting effect. If a card input has a higher value than the other
cards, the scheduler will see that you would rather record showings of
episodes on this card rather than a showing on another card. If you
have multiple cards of different quality, you may want to set input
preference to encourage the scheduler to record shows on your best
card(s) whenever possible. This can also be useful if you have
multiple video sources which include the same stations. For example,
with digital and analog cable you could increase the digital cable
input preference by 1 to tell the scheduler that you want to record
from the digital station whenever possible but the station on the
analog input could still be used when the digital input is busy.</P>
<P>For any single showing of any show you've chosen to record, these
factors are added together to find the "total priority". This is the
priority that the scheduler uses to decide which shows are given the
first choice when filling in the schedule.</P>

<H3>Scheduling decisions</H3>

<P>Here are the actual decisions made by the scheduler as it fills in the
schedule.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Currently recording beats not currently recording -- A recording in
progress can not be moved so it "wins" it's current timeslot.
</LI>
<LI>Higher total priority beats lower total priority -- This is the core of
the scheduling process. Episodes of the highest priority show are placed
on the first available card then the next highest priority and so on.
</LI>
<LI>Future start time beats passed start time -- If there is an
episode in progress and also a later showing of the same episode, it
is better to record the complete episode. If there isn't another
showing, start recording now to record the remaining portion.
This should only happen if you add a new rule while the show is in
progress or if the master backend is started after the start time of
a scheduled show.
</LI>
<LI>More specific record type beats less specific record type -- If
two shows are on at the same time and have the same total priority but
different types they will be sorted by Single then Find One, Record
Weekly, Find Weekly, Record Daily, Find Daily, Channel and finally
All. This only applies if the priorities are the same.
</LI>
<LI>If both start times have passed, later start time beats earlier start
time -- This attempts to miss the least amount of time.
</LI>
<LI>If neither start time has passed, earlier start time beats later start
time -- This rule help assure that the earliest showing of an episode has
the advantage.
</LI>
<LI>Lower input id beats higher input id -- The scheduler fills in open
time slots on the first available card. The next cards is used when there is
another show already placed for the first card.
</LI>
<LI>Older record rule beats newer record rule -- If two shows are still
equal after all of these other checks, the show whose record rule was added
first is preferred over a more recent addition.
</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Reschedule Higher Priorities</H3>

<P>Setup->TV Settings->Recording Priorities->General has a checkbox for
"Reschedule Higher Priorities" which tells the scheduler to try to be a
little smarter in certain situations. If this is checked, the scheduler will
look for situations where a show cannot record because all inputs for the
channel are used for higher priority shows. It will check to see if any of
the other shows could be recorded at another time so that the conflicting
show can be recorded in it's place.</P>
<P>Generally, this is a good strategy but there are tradeoffs. If a higher
priority show is postponed, you will not get to watch it until it is
recorded in the later timeslot. There is also a risk that the TV listings
may change and the later showing may go away. In this rare case the higher
priority show may never record. On the other hand, if you do not use this
option you will miss recording some lower priority shows unnecessarily
unless you make similar these changes manually.</P>
<P>By using Reschedule Higher Priorities, the scheduler will do a better job of
recording as many of your shows as possible when left unattended. It will
also be easy to see that shows have been marked to record at a later time.
You can then decide for yourself when you would prefer to record the first
showing.</P>

<H3>Controlling Your Schedule</H3>

<P>The Manage Recordings->Upcoming Recordings page is your control center
for the MythTV scheduler. Unlike other DVR systems, this one page gives you
all of the information and tools you need to see all of your alternatives
and make whatever adjustments you desire.</P>
<P>The upper half of the screen has a scrollable box listing items that match
your record rules sorted by time. The lower half shows the details for the
highlighted item. There are two 'views' available. Press "1" to include all
of the items that match record rules even if they do not need to be
recorded. Press "2" to focus on just the things that will record and items
that may need your attention. The message in the upper right-hand corner
will remind you when there are conflicts that would prevent one or more
shows from being recorded.</P>
<P>The items in the list are colored white for things that will record,
gray for those that do not need to record and yellow when there is a
time conflict. Items at the top of the list may also be highlighted
indicating that the recording is in progress.</P>
<P>Along with the channels, start times and titles, the right-hand column has a
status code. Numbers indicate which card number has been assigned to record
the show. Letters are used to indicate the reason that something will not be
recorded. Just below the box is a short status message for the highlighted
item that indicates the type of record rule that was matched and a one or
two word explanation of the status code. If you press SELECT, you will see
more information about the status.</P>
<P>There are a few status codes that may require your attention. "C" indicates
that there are more overlapping shows to record than there are TV tuners to
record them. "L" indicates that the scheduler found that it may be better to
record a later showing of this episode. These states happen as a result of
your choices and should normally reflect your preferences. However, you may
notice situations where you would like to modify the scheduler's initial
choices.</P>
<P>The first thing you can do is to highlight an item and press INFO once or
twice to see the Recording Options page. From this page you can change the
record rule type, the duplicate matching rules, or raise or lower the
priority to resolve whatever problem you noticed.</P>
<P>Additionally, you can treat any individual showing as an exception that you
do want to record or don't want to record. To use these "override" features,
highlight the item and press SELECT. You will see a message explaining the
current status and at least an "OK" button to exit without making changes.</P>
<P>For items scheduled to record, there will be a button for "Don't record"
which will prevent recording this showing but will still allow the same
episode to record in the future. If there is episode description
information, you may also see a button for "Never record".  This prevents
recording this showing and tells MythTV to remember that this is an episode
that you've seen or don't need to see if it is ever in the TV listings
again.</P>
<P>For items that are not scheduled to record, the message will describe the
reason and in the case of "C" or "L" it will include a list of the shows
that are scheduled to record instead. For any item that could potentially be
recorded there will be buttons for "Edit Options" and "Add Override". "Edit
Options" will allow you to change the options for the existing record rule
such as raising the priority so that the show will record. These changes
would apply to this and all future showings that match this record rule.
"Add Override" will allow you to set options that apply to the specific
showing without affecting the existing record rule.</P>
<P>If you return to an override page after an override has already been set,
you will also see a "Clear override" to undo your changes. This option makes
it very easy to try out some "what if" attempts when deciding on your best
strategy in a difficult situation.</P>

<P>Creating Power Search rules with Custom Record</P>
<P>MythTV's "Custom Record" feature gives you unlimited control for creating
specialized search recording rules to meet your needs. It allows you to
choose your criteria to search for matching shows based on any of the
information in the program listings, channel information, time functions and
more. This goes beyond the capabilities of any other DVR system and it is
unlikely that this level of scheduling customization will ever be available
in any commercial DVR system.</P>

<H3>Getting Started</H3>

<P>Go to Schedule Recordings->Custom Record. This page, titled "Power Search
Recording Rule Editor", helps you build a database search one clause at a
time. Each added clause further limits which showings will be matched in the
TV listings data. You can test the search at any time and when you are done,
you can save your search as a recording rule.</P>
<P>To familiarize yourself with how you can create custom rules, create a
simple rule to record "Nova" only in primetime.</P>
<P>The first item at the top of the page allows you to edit an existing rule or
create a new rule. Leave it on "&lt;New rule&gt;". Arrow down to the third item
which says "Match an exact title". Right and left arrows would allow you to
select any of several prefabricated pieces or full examples but leave it on
the default for now. Arrow down to "Add this example clause" and press
SELECT (Enter or Space on a keyboard). The large text box should now show:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
     program.title = "Nova"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

As you have probably guessed, this says that we want to search for all
programs with the title "Nova" regardless of the time, day, channel, etc.</P>
<P>If you do not receive a PBS station that carries "Nova" or would like to
use another title, edit the title by pressing the down arrow to highlight
the text box and right arrow over the the word "Nova". If you are using a
keyboard you can simply delete the four letters and type a different title
between the quotes. With a remote control, you can do 'cell phone' style
text entry with the number pad. The delete key is the "X" in the grouping
for "1", zero is grouped with "9" and "0" acts as the "Caps Lock" key.</P>
<P>Note: the text box honors many familiar Emacs control keys. It is also
possible to cut and paste text into the text box so you can edit with a
favorite editor or inset a rule sent in email or from other sources.</P>
<P>In any case, choose a title that is shown both in primetime and late night
or daytime. Next, click the "Test" button. You should see a list of the
upcoming episodes for "Nova" just as if you had clicked the Upcoming
button for "Nova" elsewhere in MythTV.</P>
<P>Press ESC to go back to the Custom Record page. Move to the example
selector then press the right or left arrows until you find "Only in
primetime". Click "Add this example clause". You should now see:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
            program.title = "Nova"
            AND HOUR(program.starttime) >= 19
            AND HOUR(program.starttime) &lt; 23
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Click "Test". You should now see a shorter list with only the showings that
begin between 7PM and 11PM. To create a rule for this, press ESC to go back
to the custom page and move to "Rule Name:" then type "Nova" or anything
else you would like. This is only a label and will not affect the search
results. Once a name has been entered, the "Record" button will light up.
Click this to enter the recording options page. If you named it "Nova" the
title will say "Nova (Power Search)". Set whatever options you would like
then click "Save these settings". You now have a special rule to record
"Nova" but only when it is shown in primetime.</P>
<P>To remove this, or any other rule, you can go to the "Recording Priorities"
page, arrow down to the title, press enter and change the the recording type
to "Do not record this program" then "Save these settings".</P>

<H3>How it Works</H3>

<P>MythTV stores TV program information in a database and uses the Structured
Query Language (SQL) to access the data. Information about each TV program
is stored in the 'program' table and information about each TV station you
receive is stored in 'channel'. These two tables are used in the scheduler
queries and their fields are available to be used in your rules. The rules
you create are stored in 'record'. Normal rules in MythTV simply match the
title in the rule with the titles in the 'program' table.</P>
<P>MythTV also has search rules for "Titles", "Keywords" and "People". These
store the key phrase in the rule's description field of the rule and
includes these in specialized SQL replacements for the normal title check.
There is also a type called "Power Search" which takes the raw SQL in the
description as the replacement for title matching.</P>
<P>Custom Record is a tool to help you build valid SQL for Power Search rules.
You do not need to be an SQL expert to use Custom Record because the
examples are known to work correctly and are usually self-explanatory so you
can choose the pieces you need then modify them.  Many powerful solutions to
unique problems are possible by combining the examples. With some creativity
and some knowledge of SQL, the possibilities are limitless.</P>

<H3>Common Tricks and Tips</H3>

<P>The example clauses marked "complete example" are actual rules that have
been used to address specific problems. You may find that some of these
are useful for you as is or with slight modifications. These show off how
powerful custom rules can be but there are also several simple idioms that
you may find useful for many of the shows you would like to record.</P>
<P>Wait for a known title -- If there is a movie that you anticipate will be
televised in the coming months but is not yet in the listings, you can
select "Match an exact title", edit the movie title, click "Record" then
choose "Record one showing of this title". The rule will wait weeks, months
or years until this title shows up in your listings then it will record one
showing. These rules have no impact on the scheduler throughout the day and
only take a tiny fraction of a second when the master backend starts or when
the listings are updated.</P>
<P>Silence series out of season -- "Celebrity Poker Showdown", for example,
will have new episodes for a while then long periods where reruns are shown
dozens of times per week. By checking the previously shown flag you can
create a rule that will only match new episodes.  Therefore, your schedule
won't be polluted with dozens of entries marked as "Repeat" or "Previously
Recorded".
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       program.title = "Celebrity Poker Showdown"
       AND program.previouslyshown = 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This allows you to keep rules for your favorite shows that are dormant while
out of season but will spring back to life when new episodes appear.</P>
<P>Choose showings on certain days -- Several cable stations will show their
highest rated shows a dozen on more times per week. However, the scheduler
only needs two or three choices to do a good job of making a flexible
choice.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
       program.title LIKE "Celebrity Fit Club%"
       AND DAYNAME(program.starttime) = "Sunday"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This says to choose any showing of an episode that hasn't been recorded
when it appears on Sunday. This prevents all the other showings during the
week from being listed in the schedule.</P>
<P>Notice the word "LIKE" and the "%" at the end. This does wildcard matching
so that this would match even if the title ended with "2".  "III" or
":Revenge of the Snapple Lady". This can be useful where the title may
change from one season to the next like "Survivor%", "Big Brother%" or
"The Amazing Race%".</P>

<H3>Working with SQL</H3>

<P>As you experiment, it is possible that you may misplace a quote or mistype a
word. If there is a mistake when you press "Test" or "Record" you will see
an error message returned from the database. This will usually give you a
good idea about what needs to be fixed. However, for more subtle MySQL
syntax errors, you can find more information in the documentation at 
<A HREF="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/</A>. This contains a lot of
information that can be useful for Power Search rules such as the "Date and
Time Functions". There are many other good resources for SQL on the Web.</P>
<P>While the example clauses demonstrate how many of the data fields may be
used, you can get a more complete list of all the fields that are available
by using a MySQL client program:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
$ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg
mysql> describe program;
mysql> describe channel;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This will show the names of all of the fields along with their type and
default value. Most are easy to understand but a few need some explanation
in order to use them effectively with Power Search.
<UL>
<LI>"program.category_type" holds one of these exact four strings: "movie",
"series", "sports" or "tvshow".
</LI>
<LI>"program.airdate" is a string representing the year of release for movies
and may have no meaning for other types of shows.
</LI>
<LI>"program.stars" is a floating point number from 0.0 to 1.0. On a four star
scale, 1.0 would be four stars, 0.75 would be three stars and so on.
</LI>
<LI>"program.originalairdate" if provided is the date when a show
was, or will be, first televised. This may be useful for finding
episodes before or after a certain date such as finding just the
original series of "Battlestar Galactica".
</LI>
<LI>"program.previouslyshown" is a field created by myth to try to determine if
a showing is more than 14 days after it's original air date or if the show
was marked as a repeat and did not have and have a date for the first
airing. If this is "0" it usually means that this is a brand new show or a
rebroadcast within the first two weeks.
</LI>
<LI>"program.programid" is the Tribune Media Service database record identifier
for each program description. In general, these start with a two letter
prefix, MV, EP, SP or SH that correspond to the "program.category_type". 
For most, the last four digits are "0000" except EP where the last four
digits are the episode number in the series. Note that these are generated
by TMS and not the show's producers but they are usually in the same order a
the original air dates for the episodes. Detailed information can be found
in the Data Direct documentation at 
<A HREF="http://labs.zap2it.com/">http://labs.zap2it.com/</A> .</LI>
</UL>

Finally, if you are doing something very experimental and a field is not
giving you the results you had anticipated, you can always check the MythTV
source code to see exactly how a field is used. The open source for MythTV
is available from

<P>The import path in the setup dialog is a colon separated list of
directories and/or executable files.  When the import key is pressed, a new
directory (the destination directory) under the current directory will be
created and the import path will be searched.  If the item in the import
path is a directory (the source directory), the contents of that directory
will be copied to the destination directory. If you would like the source
directory to be that of a removable device, it might be a good idea to use
autofs.  See the automount howto at 
<A HREF="www.linuxdoc.org">www.linuxdoc.org</A> for info on how to get it working.</P>
<P>If the item in the import path is an executable file, MythGallery will
attempt to execute it with the destination directory as its sole argument.
Be careful when using executable scripts that the script runs unattended
(doesn't need user intervention) and returns properly, otherwise it could
create the appearance of MythGallery hanging (e.g. running
<B>smbclient</B> and prompting for password).  Also be sure that scripts
have executable permissions set.</P>
<P>Here is an example script that a user may want to run
on import:

<H2><A NAME="ss16.5">16.5</A> <A HREF="#toc16.5">Configuring MythMusic</A>
</H2>

<P>Configuration of MythMusic occurs in two places.  The main mythfrontend
Setup is for global MythMusic configuration.  Go to the
Setup/MythMusic/General Setup screen and adjust it for your particular
configuration.</P>
<P>The second configuration screen is within the MythMusic program and will
allow you rescan your music library, etc.</P>
<P>Here's some explanation about the Ignore_ID3 and The NonID3FileNameFormat:</P>
<P>If Ignore_ID3 is set to TRUE, MythMusic will try to determine the
Genre, Artist, Album, Track Number, and Title from the filename of the
mp3 file.  The NonID3FileNameFormat variable should be set to the
directory/file format where the mp3 files are stored.  For instance, I
store mine in the above shown Genre/Artist/Album/Track format.  MythMusic
will then use this information to fill in the proper fields when it
populates the musicmetadata table rather than searching for an ID3 tag in
the mp3 file.</P>
<P>The files can be laid out in any format, such as:</P>
<P>Genre/Artist/Album/Title
Artist/Genre/Album/Title
Artist/Album/Title (with Genre left as Unknown)</P>
<P>The track number is optional but can be specified with the title by using
the TRACK_TITLE keyword instead of TITLE.  If TRACK_TITLE is used,
then the filename can have a space, hyphen, or underscore separating the
track number from the track title.  Keywords are case insensitive, so if
you specify GENRE it's the same as Genre in the format field.</P>
<P>The Ignore_ID3 option does not disable the code that determines the track
length, just the portion that tries to read ID3 info.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss16.6">16.6</A> <A HREF="#toc16.6">Using MythMusic</A>
</H2>

<P>MythMusic is fairly simple to use.  It is recommended that you insert the
CD before selecting "Import CD".  You should also ensure that your system
doesn't try to automount the CD and begin playing it automatically.</P>
<P>Here's some information on playlist management:</P>
<P>Q: How do I create a new playlist?  
A: Using the MythMusic "Select Music" menu option, setup the playlist as you
normally would by adding songs or other playlists as needed.  When you are
ready to save the new playlist, highlight "Active Play Queue" at the bottom
of the selection tree and hit the "i" key. This will pop up a menu allowing
you to name and save the new playlist.  You can also hit Enter to bring up
the popup on the Active Play Queue. This does not work on the playlists
above, as Enter is obviously bound to checking/unchecking the boxes. Any
number (i.e. keypad on remote) will also bring up the menu in both cases.</P>
<P>Q: How do I enter the playlist name in the text field without a keyboard?
A: Use the keypad number keys (bound to your remote) to select letters
quasi-cell phone style. Keys 2-9 work pretty much like any cell phone text
entry. 1 cycles through a few special characters, delete, and space. 0 is
like a CAPS LOCK. Hard to describe, fairly easy to use. You will soon be
able to specify the cycle timing in a Setup screen. You can type fairly
quickly through a combination of jumping around the number keys AND hitting
a non-number key (right arrow is particularly good for this) to force the
current character.</P>
<P>Q: How do I edit a playlist? 
A: Highlight the playlist in the selection tree and hit the "i" key then
select "Move to Active Play Queue" in the popup.  You can now modify the
"Active Play Queue" like normal, adding songs and playlists by selecting
them from the song tree.  When you are done, highlight the "Active Play
Queue" in the selection tree and hit the "i" key then select "Save Back to
Playlist Tree".  And whatever you were editing as your Active Queue before
you moved an existing playlist "on top" of Active reappears. Think of Active
has having a push on, pop off capability, but with a depth of only 1.</P>
<P>Q: How do I delete an item from a playlist?
A: Highlight the item in the selection tree and hit the "d" key.</P>
<P>Q: How do I rearrange the songs in my playlist?
A: Highlight a song and hit the "space" bar, the song will now have pair of
red arrows in front of it.  Use the up and down arrow keys to move it around
in the playlist.  When you have it where you want it, hit the "space" bar
again.</P>
<P>Q: How do I delete a playlist?
A: Highlight the playlist in the selection tree and hit the "i" key then
select "Delete this Playlist" from the popup.</P>

<P>The full text of the message will say: </P>
<P>databasebox.o: Couldn't find your CD. It may not be in the freedb database. 
More likely, however, is that you need to delete &nbsp;/.cddb and &nbsp;/.cdserverrc
and restart mythmusic. Have a nice day.</P>
<P>If you get this message, you should go to the home directory of whatever

</P>
<P>These files aren't automatically deleted because of a conscious design
decision by the author that programs that automatically delete things are
bad.</P>
<P>The files are used to locally cache CD lookups. If you are re-inserting
CDs, your machine will not actually have to go out to the Internet to
determine what is on them.  However, the URL used to access the freedb
database has recently changed, so the stale information in the files from
previous runs of MythMusic would cause the error above.  Once the files have
been deleted the stale information will be gone and your local database
will be rebuilt as you use CDs.</P>

<P>MythWeather also has an "Aggressiveness" setting.  This affects how long
MythWeather waits for data from the msnbc.com website before timing out.  If
you are on a slow connection, or have a slow DNS, or MythWeather just
doesn't seem to be working and you've already tried everything else, then
try increasing the aggressiveness level parameter.  This parameter is
inverse; a higher number actually means that MythWeather will be less
aggressive, and will therefore wait longer before timing out.</P>
<P>MythWeather will print debugging information on the terminal.  If you wish
to see additional debugging information while MythWeather is running, run
mythweather from the command line with as <CODE>mythweather --debug</CODE></P>
<P>You may also force mythweather to re-run the configuration by starting it on
the command line as <CODE>mythweather --configure</CODE>.  These two options are
mutually exclusive.</P>

then it shouldn't be a problem.</P>
<P>If you get an error like <CODE>/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lXext</CODE>, the

your distribution hasn't set it up correctly.  This needs to be fixed before
MythTV will compile.</P>

<H3>error: can't find a register in class 'BREG' while reloading 'asm'</H3>

<P>This is due to the broken Qt that is being distributed by Suse.  To work
around this, edit <CODE>libs/libavcodec/Makefile</CODE> and remove any
"-fPIC" you find there and then recompile.</P>

and then restart the compile,</P>
<P>or</P>
<P>2.  Run <B>qmake mythtv.pro</B> in the mythtv directory.  Rerunning
<B>qmake</B> will create a new Makefile for you, however this still
doesn't fix the root cause of the issue, which is that your distribution

<H3>Using a MPEG-2 encoder card and the video appears "jittery"</H3>

<H3>Using a MPEG-2 encoder card and the video is jumping up and down</H3>

<P>This is a different problem than the one discussed in the previous
section.  Currently, the ivtv driver or firmware appear to have some issues
if the vertical capture resolution is not the full screen height.  If you
are having a jitter problem then ensure that you are capturing either 480
lines (for NTSC) or 576 lines (for PAL).  The default capture profiles may
need to be edited for your setup.  Go to Settings->TV Settings->Recording
Profiles and adjust the <B>Default</B> and <B>Live TV</B> options to
480 or 576 from their defaults.</P>

<H3>Screen goes blank but returns when mouse is moved or keyboard is used</H3>

<P>This is due to DPMS, the Display Power Management System, which is used
to save power by turning off your monitor when the system decides that it's
not being used or due to a screensaver that has defaulted to a blank screen. 
MythTV now has DPMS support built-in, and should intelligently handle the
screen.  Continue reading if you wish to override DPMS and force it off.</P>
<P>Since it's likely that watching TV will not generate keyboard or mouse
events for a time, you need to turn off DPMS and the screensaver.  There are
a few ways to do this.  You may also need to check your BIOS for power
saving modes and disable screen blanking there as well.</P>

</P>
<P>From the listing above, you can see that hda, hdb and hdc are set for DMA,
and hdd is set for pio.  If your kernel is not reporting DMA being enabled,
you may need to recompile your kernel. Check your motherboard's chipset
(look in the "ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support" section in "make menuconfig") for more
information.</P>
<P>Next, check that the hard drive has DMA enabled.  Use the <B>hdparm</B>
program to check and enable DMA.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 will tell you the DMA status for your hard drives.  If you run
<B>hdparm</B> with the <CODE>-d1</CODE> parameter, it will turn DMA on.</P>

<P>You may also setup your PC to do this at boot time, either by adding the
command to your <CODE>/etc/rc.local</CODE> file, or by adding files to
/etc/sysconfig.</P>
<P>On Mandrake and other distributions, if you install <B>hdparm</B> from an RPM you
will most likely get a <CODE>/etc/sysconfig/harddisks</CODE> file installed. 
This file will be parsed by the <CODE>/etc/rc.sysinit</CODE> script.  If you use

<P>Audio appears to be one of the bigger issues that users run into on the
mailing list.  If the audio isn't configured correctly, then MythTV will
often appear to hang, when in fact it is trying to manipulate the audio
subsystem and failing.  You may or may not receive error messages indicating
that the source of the error is the audio subsystem.</P>
<P>You can not use <B>xawtv</B> to determine if your audio is working
correctly, since <B>xawtv</B> is simply using the analog sound patched
through line-in to line-out. It doesn't need to digitize the sound unless
you are using the recording function.</P>
<P>A better test to verify that sound will work for MythTV (and recording with
<B>xawtv</B> for that matter) is to startup <B>xawtv</B>, mute the
line-in then run <CODE>aplay /dev/dsp</CODE>. You should hear the recorded audio
slightly delayed behind the real-time video. You should see messages about
"underrun". These can be ignored but they do confirm that the driver is
loaded and there is an active device. Once this test succeeds, MythTV
should work correctly because it writes to and read from /dev/dsp in
the same way that <B>aplay</B> does.</P>
<P>To record audio along with video the audio signal must be digitized by a DSP
so that the audio data can be stored in a file. On playback, the audio data
is written to /dev/dsp and converted back to an analog signal. This analog
signal should then be sent to your speakers. Here is what is needed in
<B>alsamixer</B>. If you are using an ALSA version after 1.0.6, use
<B>alsamixer -V all</B>:</P>
<P>CAPTUR source - the analog source to be sent to the DSP. This should be set
to the input source from the tuner card to the sound card. In most cases
this is Line but this could also be Aux, CD, Mic, etc., depending on how you
connect the input cable. This source should be muted to prevent patching
through the analog sound. The volume of this source will not affect the
record level.</P>
<P>Capture mixer - this sets the level for the analog to digital recording.
While a volume of 100% is recommended for testing, distortion may occur.
Lowering this level to 75% to 85% may result in better audio quality.
"Capture" should be marked as the CAPTUR destination.</P>
<P>PCM mixer - this sets the level for the digital to analog playback. While a
volume of 100% is recommended for testing, distortion may occur. Lowering
this level to 75% to 85% may result in better audio quality.</P>
<P>Master mixer - sets the level for the analog signal sent to line-out or the
speakers.</P>
<P>You may also want to ensure that <CODE>/dev/dsp</CODE> , or whatever device file
is being used, hasn't already been grabbed by another process, like
<B>esd</B> or <B>artsd</B>.  If the device file isn't available, then
MythTV won't work.  You may wish to run <B>configure</B> and enable
support for these.</P>
<P>If you wish to see what application is grabbing a resource, you can use the

<H3>Mythbackend reports that your card is not reporting full duplex capabilities</H3>

<H3>The mythbackend program told me to look at this section</H3>

<P>mythbackend does a check to see if your sound device is capable of full
duplex operation.  If it's not, it's most likely that you're going to run
into issues when you try to record and play sound at the same time.  If your
backend is a separate machine than your frontend, then there's no problem,
since you're only going to be doing one thing at a time with the card. 
Likewise, if you're running the frontend and backend on the same machine,
but you're using btaudio or a hardware encoder card such as the Hauppauge
PVR-250, DVB cards or HDTV capture cards as your recording source and you're
only using the playback function of your sound card, then you also shouldn't
have an issue, since the sound card isn't being asked to perform two
functions at once.</P>
<P>If you can't get your sound card to go full-duplex and need it to, then check
your distribution for updated sound drivers.  If your sound card is not
capable of full-duplex operation, either because the drivers don't support
it, or it has been designed that way, then you're pretty much out of luck
and will either need to purchase a new sound card, or will need to get
btaudio

<H3>My remote doesn't work / works sometimes and not others / "ghost" keypresses</H3>

<P>This can be due to a number of factors.  The simplest case is the
"ghost" keypresses.  For me, it was due to compact fluorescent lights in
the same room as the IR receiver, which the receiver was picking up as
keypresses.  Once the lights were switched to incandescent bulbs, the ghost
went away.</P>
<P>You may have an issue with <B>lirc</B> misinterpreting IR commands from a
different remote.  I also have an issue where the TiVo "Peanut" remote will
eventually cause <B>lircd</B> to stop responding; even though <B>lircd</B>
is configured for the Pinnacle Systems remote, the TiVo remote IR patterns
are being seen by the IR receiver.</P>
<P>If your remote has been properly configured, and <B>irw</B> and
<B>irxevent</B> are working correctly, then it's highly likely that your
window manager is not giving focus correctly to the various Myth programs as
they run.  The following window managers are known to work correctly:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>fvwm</LI>
<LI>blackbox  (using "Sloppy Focus" and "Focus New Windows")</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>:  You do not need to use <B>irxevent</B> if you are using
MythTV's native LIRC support, so the window manager focus issue does not
apply in that case.</P>

<H3>Where's "canada-cable"?</H3>

<H3>Channels are off by one</H3>

<P>There is no such thing as "Canada Cable"; Canada uses the same
frequencies as the United States.  "Canada Cable" was a hack that some
people used when they would discover that their channels were off-by-one,
i.e. when tuning to channel 42, they might get channel 41 or 43.  This is
actually due to the tuner on the video capture device being mis-detected. 
You must manually specify the tuner type in your <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE>. 
See the video4linux mailing list (

<H3>What does "strange error flushing buffer" mean on the console?</H3>

</H2>

<P>MythTV comes with a utility called <B>mythtranscode</B> which can
decode nuv files into raw format for use with other applications.  This
command-line utility was not designed to be used by the end-user, but
instead to be called by other applications or scripts.  Programs like
<B>mkmovie</B> (
<A HREF="http://www.icelus.org/">http://www.icelus.org/</A>) and <B>nuvexport</B> (
<A HREF="http://forevermore.net/myth/">http://forevermore.net/myth/</A>) are
better suited for the end user.  However, since <B>mythtranscode</B> can
be a useful tool, directions on using it follow.</P>
<P><B>mythtranscode</B> creates raw streams, which means that they do not
contain any container information such as resolution, frame-rate, or audio
sampling rate.  In order to process the output, you must supply this
information to the processing utility.  <B>mythtranscode</B> provides the
relevant information on STDOUT.</P>
<P>There are two modes in which <B>mythtranscode</B> can create raw streams. 
The first has no synchronization and assumes that the processing utility
will read audio and video at a constant rate.  This method is useful when a
single application will be processing the raw output, such as
<B>mencoder</B> or <B>ffmpeg</B>.  The second method assumes that two
separate applications will be processing the audio and video streams
independently, and there is no rate control between them which means that
the two programs don't coordinate their efforts to maintain synchronization.</P>

<P>When <B>mythtranscode</B> begins executing, it will create two FIFOs

<P>The next step is to start the processing application.  The following assumes

</H2>

<P>MythTV is not dependent on any particular window manager.  If you wish to

example of a <CODE>.twmrc</CODE> and <CODE>.fvwmrc</CODE> file you may use.</P>

<H2><A NAME="capture_resolution_"></A> <A NAME="ss22.3">22.3</A> <A HREF="#toc22.3">What capture resolution should I use?  How does video work?</A>
</H2>

<P>While MythTV allows you to set various GUI and capture resolutions, not
all combinations make sense.</P>
<P>First, analog video signals have a defined vertical resolution.  In NTSC,
the video standard specifies that there are 525 vertical scan lines.  Once
the "extra" lines are removed (they're used to synchronize the video signal,
and encode closed captioning data), you have 480 horizontal lines stacked
vertically.</P>
<P>In PAL, there are 625 "raw" lines of resolution, with a net of 576
horizontal lines stacked vertically.</P>
<P>Horizontally, the maximum value allowed for a Bt8X8 chip is 720. However,
due to limitations in the chip and other limitations of broadcast
television, there may not be a noticeable improvement in image quality
beyond 400 or 500 pixels.</P>
<P>With this in mind, there are certain commonly accepted values for
resolution.  While other values may be accepted for the vertical
resolution, they will cause scan lines to be repeated or dropped.</P>
<P>From "best" to "worst", in NTSC:
<UL>
<LI>720x480 ("DVD" resolution. Also commonly, 704x480)</LI>
<LI>640x480 4:3</LI>
<LI>544x480 (TiVo high resolution)</LI>
<LI>480x480 (Video CD resolution)</LI>
<LI>352x480 (ReplayTV "Standard" quality)</LI>
<LI>320x480 </LI>
<LI>544x240</LI>
<LI>480x240 </LI>
<LI>352x240 </LI>
<LI>320x240</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>As you can see, the lower quality values are half of the better ones. 
720x240 is possible, but isn't a good tradeoff relative to the number of
vertical lines lost.  In a PAL country, the you would use values like
720x576 or x288.</P>
<P>The higher resolutions will be more CPU intensive if you're using software
encoding (PVR-250/350 will have minimal host CPU impact even if you're using
720x480). If the CPU is overtaxed, frames will be dropped causing uneven
motion. You will likely see the best results at resolutions which average at
least 10% CPU idle time.  You can use system tools such as <CODE>top</CODE> or
<CODE>sar</CODE> to check the CPU % idle while recording.  If the CPU average
usage is consistently exceeding 90%, frames will need to be dropped during
peak times when more than 100% of the available CPU would be needed to
process all of the frames.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss22.4">22.4</A> <A HREF="#toc22.4">MythTV GUI and X Display Sizes</A>
</H2>

<P>MythTV is designed to be run as dedicated full screen TV application
but can also be run as a desktop application on a computer monitor. Here
are a few consideration for configuring sizes to best suit you needs.</P>

<H3>X Dimensions</H3>

<P>For output to a Television, common resolutions are 640x480, 800x600, and
some rare devices support 1024x768. Generally, higher resolutions are
better. However, you may find that you prefer the picture quality at one of
the lower resolutions. Everything in MythTV is scalable and should 'fit'
regardless of the resolution you choose.</P>
<P>Edit your X configuration file, usually <CODE>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</CODE> for
XFree, or <CODE>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</CODE> for Xorg, so that the resolution you
want to use is listed first in the lists under "Screen". If this resolution
is higher than the resolutions supported by your output device, you will see
a 'panning' effect where moving the mouse to the edge will scroll around a
desktop area which is larger than the display size. If this happens, edit
your X configuration file to match the display size then restart X.</P>

<H3>MythTV Dimensions</H3>

<P>In 0.10 and later, from "mythfrontend" go to Setup->Appearance.
The default for the height and width is "0" - this will cause
MythTV to automatically size itself to full screen.</P>
<P>If the MythTV GUI width and height are not 0, mythfrontend uses these GUI
dimensions and is anchored to the upper left corner of the X Desktop. If
the GUI X and/or Y are not 0, the upper left corner is positioned at the
specified coordinates. If the "Run the frontend in a window" box is checked,
the window will have a frame and can then be dragged to any position on the
desktop.</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="stop.eps">
<IMG SRC="stop.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>: When the GUI is full screen, you may see windows rapidly
flipping on top of each other. If this happens you will need to set your
window manager to 'Click to Focus' for windows to stack properly.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>

The fonts for the GUI and OSD will scale to whatever sizes you use. Most
font sizes can be changed in setup selections or in the .xml files under
<CODE>/usr/local/share/mythtv/</CODE> . Make sure to use fonts large enough
to be read on a TV screen from a distance.</P>
<P>The full screen TV size is based on the X display size. For Xinerama, you
can specify a screen in Setup->General. The TV picture will be stretched
to fit the entire GUI area regardless of the 
<A HREF="#capture_resolution_">capture resolutions</A> used. However, during playback, the "W" key can
to used to correct differences between 16:9 and 4:3.</P>

<H3>Overscan Dimensions</H3>

<P>Because picture edges can be ragged and screen edges aren't straight,
Television is designed to project an image larger than the physical screen.
This is called "overscan". Underscan is fitting the entire image inside the
screen. Underscan is useful for computer monitors so that toolbars and
scrollbars at the edges can be seen.</P>
<P>For best results, match the X display area as close as possible to the edges
of the physical screen. This can only be adjusted by your tv-out device or
by the settings for the television set. Many sets have these adjustments in
a 'service mode'. If you cannot make these adjustments, there will be black
borders around the edges of the X desktop, MythTV GUI and TV playback.</P>
<P>MythTV has settings for "Overscan" in Setup->Playback. These can not, and do
not, cause the image to display beyond the edge of the X display area. The
purpose of these settings are to cut off rough edges and to expand the image
so that objects will appear to be the same size as a normal overscanned TV
picture.</P>

<P>If <B>mythfilldatabase</B> grabbed a channel which you do not want to

system, but is scrambled because you're not a subscriber to that channel. 
Since you can never watch it, you want to get rid of it.</P>
<P>If you are using the DataDirect service, login to your account at

<B>xmltv</B> from grabbing future listings.</P>
<P>Next, delete the unwanted item from the channel table so that it will not
appear in the EPG or when changing channels.  To delete the data from the

<H2><A NAME="advanced_backend_config"></A> <A NAME="ss22.13">22.13</A> <A HREF="#toc22.13">Advanced Backend Configurations </A>
</H2>

<P>MythTV is flexible in the way that you define multiple backend tuner
configurations.  The only hard-and-fast rule is that the Master backend
<EM>must</EM> have a capture device defined, but shouldn't imply that the
capture device in the Master backend must be the first capture card defined in the
database.</P>
<P>One example of an advanced configuration is the round-robin scheme.  Rather
than defining all of the cards on the master, you could first go into setup
on the master to define globals such as the general configuration and the
channel lineup but not the host-specific configuration item like the capture
card.  In this example, we will use a 4 tuner configuration, where two
slaves have one card each and the master has two.
<OL>
<LI>Add the first capture card on one of the slaves.  Complete the
configuration, connecting the input source to the card.  This will get
cardid #1 in the database.  Exit setup.</LI>
<LI>Configure the first capture card on the master backend.  This will get
cardid #2 in the database.  Exit setup.</LI>
<LI>Configure the first capture card on the second slave.  This will be
cardid #3 in the database.  Exit setup.</LI>
<LI>Configure the second capture card on the master backend.  This will
get cardid #4 in the database.  Exit setup.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Using this scheme, the master backend will not use both capture cards until
one of the following happens:
<UL>
<LI>There are four recordings scheduled for the same time</LI>
<LI>Both slaves are unavailable</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The scheduler in MythTV checks whether an encoder is available; if a slave
backend isn't running, its encoder isn't available, so the scheduler will
look for the next available encoder.  This makes MythTV very flexible; slave
tuners can come and go, and as long as there are enough tuners for what
you'd like to record it doesn't matter which tuner in particular is going to
be used.</P>
<P>Using this round-robin scheme along with a shared storage directory like
NFS and enabling the Master Backend Override setting will allow you to view
content even if the slave backend that recorded a program is not available.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss22.14">22.14</A> <A HREF="#toc22.14">What is this transcoder thing, and how do I use it?</A>
</H2>

<P>The transcoder re-encodes files from one MythTV format to another.  The
main purpose of the transcoder is to allow users with hardware
encoders (PVR-250) or systems that can only record in RTjpeg due to
performance reasons (multiple capture cards, slow system, etc) to create
MPEG-4 streams to save space.</P>
<P>The transcoder can be used in two ways:
<UL>
<LI>Automatically re-encode every file once it has completed recording</LI>
<LI> After marking commercials, the transcoder can be run manually to
delete the commercials from the file (thus further saving space)</LI>
</UL>

The two methods are independent.  The first is an automatic process that can be
enabled/disabled through the setup program; the second is a manual method which
must be invoked on each recording individually.</P>
<P>The second method can be used on files that have already been transcoded (or
files which were are already in the correct format), so only the frames
immediately following a cut section will be re-encoded, resulting in a very
minimal loss of quality.</P>
<P>To enable automatic transcoding, do the following:
start the setup program
under the host-specific settings:
set the Transcoder Auto-run checkbox</P>
<P>For either manual or automatic transcoding:
start mythbackend
start mythfrontend
select setup, and the Transcoding recording profile.
now select either RTjpeg or MPEG-4 (selecting any of the hardware
encoders will result in the transcoder not working).
set the other parameters as you'd like.  For best performance, you
should match the audio to the 'Default' profile.  If you plan to
only use the manual transcoder, you can choose to set the video to
be the same as the default profile too (as long as it is MPEG-4 or
RTjpeg)</P>
<P>Everything should now be setup properly.  If you elected to use the
Auto-Run feature, the transcoder will automatically launch after each
recording is complete.  The transcoder thread runs at a low priority, so it
should not impact any critical tasks or other recordings.</P>
<P>If you want to manually transcode a program, simply press 'X' while
watching a recording (you should have already finished marking all
commercials).  If you change your mind, hitting 'X' again will stop the
transcoding.</P>
<P>Once the transcode is complete, mythbackend will replace the old file
with the new as soon as it is no longer in use.</P>

</H2>

<P>If you need to change the name of the computers used with MythTV you'll
need to perform a sequence of steps.  There are a number of pieces of
information that MythTV keeps track of which are tied to the hostname of the
box, so changing the hostname involves altering the name in the
operating system and in the MySQL database.  In the examples below, the old
name of the system was "frontend1" and we're going to change it to
"kidsroom".</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="stop.eps">
<IMG SRC="stop.png">
<CAPTION><B>NOTE</B>:  Changing the hostname using direct SQL update commands will
break things.  You <EM>MUST</EM> use this indirect method.</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>
 </P>
<P>1.  Stop all backends.  If you run <B>mythbackend</B> from a terminal

<P>While it is true that the TiVo runs the Linux kernel, and TiVo has released

</H2>

<P>Yes, assuming that your wireless connection has sufficient bandwidth to
maintain the datarate between the frontend and the backend.  802.11b should
be sufficient if the encoded bitrate of the content is less than the
datarate of your wireless connection, which in the case of 802.11b would be
approximately 4 Mbps.  (The advertised rate of 11Mbps gives an actual
throughput of 4 Mbps.) 802.11a and 802.11g, if operating in their high-speed
modes, or proprietary 802.11b "Turbo" schemes should be adequate.  Multiple
wireless frontends, poor signal strength or other factors can severely

<H2><A NAME="ss22.19">22.19</A> <A HREF="#toc22.19">How can I burn shows that I have recorded to a DVD?</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two answers to this question.  The easiest thing to do is to
simply burn the MythTV files onto the DVD and treat the DVD as if it were a
hard drive.  This will allow you to save the programs, but it's likely that
they will <EM>not</EM> be playable in a DVD player because the disc will
simply contain files and not any DVD structure.  If you'd like to create a
DVD that will play in a standard DVD player and your files have been
recorded as MPEG-2 from a device supported by the IVTV driver, the first
step you'll need to perform is to remux the file to make it DVD compliant. 
Next, you'll use <B>dvdauthor</B>, <B>mkisofs</B> to create the ISO
image, and finally <B>dvdrecord</B> to burn that to a blank DVD-R.</P>
<P>The requirements for this procedure are <B>mjpegtools</B> (provides
<B>mplex</B>) and <B>dvdauthor</B> (provides <B>mpeg2desc</B> and
<B>dvdauthor</B>).</P>
<P>This script will perform the necessary steps. You'll need to pass it the
.nuv file and a name for the new DVD project.  You should end up with a
directory which you can <B>mkisofs</B> into a ISO file then burn it.</P>

<H3>CREATING A MENU</H3>

<P>This is potentially the most difficult step in creating a DVD with a menu.
You must capture or create a background image with the appropriate
resolution and <B>mplex</B> it together with an audio file (typically
silence, although though you may use sound) and then create overlay images
that show</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>the menu text</LI>
<LI>the highlighted buttons</LI>
<LI>the selected buttons  </LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>You would then use <B>spumux</B> to combine the background video with the
overlay menus.</P>
<P>The background image must be saved as a JPG and the overlay images must be
PNG with a maximum of three colors.  Four colors are allowed, but the
transparent background counts as one of the available colors.  In these
examples, the background file is called <CODE>menu.jpg</CODE>, the menu text is called
<CODE>menu1.png</CODE> and the highlighted and selected buttons are the same and called
<CODE>menu2.png</CODE>.</P>


<H3>Create a Background </H3>

<P>To get a background image, use <B>avidemux2</B> and find the frame you
wish to use as a background image.  Save the frame as
<CODE>menu.jpg</CODE> by executing <CODE>File -> Save -> Save JPG Image</CODE>.  </P>
<P>You may also create your own background image in the GIMP.  Use the following

<H3>Merge the background you just created with audio </H3>

<P>You will need some sort of audio to <B>mplex</B> with the M2V file you

<P>Open the background <CODE>menu.jpg</CODE> file in the GIMP.  Add a transparent layer
over the background and mark where you will want the different buttons to be
located.  This layer will later be deleted, so it doesn't have to be clean. 
When creating this layer, use all the colors you want to use in your
buttons.  Remember, no more than three colors.</P>
<P>Delete the Background layer.</P>
<P>Change the image to an indexed color mode.  Do this by right-clicking on
the image and selecting <CODE>Image -> Mode -> Indexed</CODE>.  Enter "4" in the
number of colors.</P>
<P>Create two new layers.</P>
<P>In the top layer, you will enter the text for your buttons.  Select the
color you want for your text either in the color palette or by using the
Color Picker Tool.  To use the Color Picker, you must make sure you have
that bottom layer selected.  Enter the text for all the buttons on the top
layer according to whatever layout you decided on.</P>
<P>Now you will create the actual buttons by drawing boxes around the text
and filling that area with the Color Fill Tool.  Be sure and select the
color you want (contrasting to the text) and to create your boxes in the
second from the top layer.</P>
<P>Delete that bottom layer which we stated earlier would be deleted.</P>
<P>Save the current image as <CODE>menu2.png</CODE>.  Do that by right-clicking
and selecting <CODE>File -> Save as</CODE>, and make the name <CODE>menu.png</CODE>. 
Click "Export" and make sure that "Save Background Color" and "Save
Resolution" are selected.</P>
<P>Select the bottom layer and change the Opacity to 0%.  Now save the image 
as <CODE>menu1.png</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss22.22">22.22</A> <A HREF="#toc22.22">Using the DBoxII within MythTV</A>
</H2>

<P>The configuration of the DBoxII for use within MythTV is tricky 
(as of May 16 2005), that's why it's covered here. Your DBoxII has to be 
running linux and the Neutrino GUI instead of the stock BetaNova firmware. 
For further information, please refer to 
<A HREF="http://www.tuxbox.org">http://www.tuxbox.org</A>. Additionally, you need to enable the SPTS mode in 
Neutrino.</P>
<P>1.) Add a new "Capture Card" in the setup. The "Card type" is "DBOX2 Input", 
the other values have to be adjusted according to your setup. 
The default values, except for the "DBOX2 host ip", should work fine.
2.) Define a new video source. It doesn't need to be configured, 
you just need to define it. MythTV grabs the EPG from the DBoxII.
3.) Connect the DBoxII to the newly defined input source in "input connections".
4.) Since channel scanning is not implemented yet, you need to define channels 
in the "Channel Editor". Make sure that you use the same value for 
"Channel Name" as on the DBoxII. You can get a list of available 
channels from the web interface of Neutrino at http://ip-of-your-box:80/. 
Associate the channel with your new video source and repeat when needed.</P>
<P>You may leave the Setup now and proceed as usual.</P>

<P>DataDirect will use different information for your video sources and
channels than was used by XMLTV. The following will clear your old

to continue to work as you'd expect.</P>
<P>The first step is to create a backup of your database using the
instructions found in 
<A HREF="#backupdb">Saving or restoring the database</A></P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: Examine the contents of the backup file to be sure that the

<P><B>NOTE</B>: The MythTV DataDirect grabber requires <B>wget</B> version
1.9.1 or later. Verify that this is installed before modifying your

<H2><A NAME="ss22.25">22.25</A> <A HREF="#toc22.25">What is the difference between a PVR-250 and a PVR-350</A>
</H2>

<P>This is covered in the hardware section, and extensively covered on the
Hauppauge website.  Briefly recapping:</P>
<P>A PVR-250 (model 980) is primarily a MPEG-2 encoder.  It has a tuner,
composite and SVideo connection for video, and an 1/8" audio jack for stereo
analog audio.  It also has an IR receiver and comes with a remote control.</P>
<P>The PVR-250 MCE (Media Center Edition, aka model 975)) contains a FM radio
tuner.  The tuner is currently not support by MythTV.  The PVR-250 MCE does
not contain a IR receiver or a remote.</P>
<P>The PVR-250 Rev 1 contained an MPEG-2 decoder.  However, this function was
not connected to any output jacks, and there doesn't appear to be any way to
pull decoded video from the card, so it's a fairly useless feature.</P>
<P>The PVR-350 (model 990) has the features of the PVR-250 as well as being
able to decode MPEG-2.  The encode and decode functions may be used
simultaneously.  The MPEG-2 decoder function gives superior video quality. 
However, the decoder function is only available once Linux has started, so
you will not see any boot-time messages.</P>
<P>Also, the card does not support any 3D functions, making it a poor gamer
card.</P>
<P>Non-MPEG-2 content will be displayed on the PVR-350 output using framebuffer
features, placing a large load on the host CPU.</P>
<P>Note that for the PVR-350 there are some 
<A HREF="#PVR-350">considerations</A>
regarding the way audio is handled.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss22.26">22.26</A> <A HREF="#toc22.26">Changing channels on an external Set Top Box</A>
</H2>

<P>If you need to use an external Set Top Box (STB), such as for satellite
TV or for digital cable you will need some way for MythTV to tell the STB to
switch to a new channel.  There are several methods:
<OL>
<LI>Use an IR blaster.  An IR blaster is an infrared transmitter connected
to your computer.  When MythTV needs to change channels it will send IR
pulses, thereby emulating a remote control.</LI>
<LI>Use a direct serial connection.  Some STB's have a serial port on the
back, although it may not look like a serial port.  It may look like a phone
jack, or a strange VGA connector.  It may be labeled "Low Speed Data".  A
direct serial connection is more reliable than an IR blaster.  Not all STB's
that have a Low Speed Data port have it enabled; you may need to convince
your service provider to turn it on.  Stating that you have a Tivo may help;
the Tivo has a direct-connect capability.</LI>
<LI>Use a firewire connection.  There is a <CODE>6200ch.c</CODE> in the MythTV
contrib directory which may work for you.</LI>

<P>Commercial flagging can be CPU intensive.  By default, the backend that
created a recording is the one which will flag commercials.  You may wish to
use a different machine to run commercial flagging.</P>
<P>On the slower machine:</P>
<P>Start the backend setup program.  Advance through the pages until you get to
the Job Queue page.  Turn off the setting that says "Allow Commercial
Detection jobs", thereby preventing any commercial flagging jobs from
running on this machine.</P>
<P>Next, make sure that "Run Jobs only on original recording host" is turned
OFF so that new jobs are allowed to run anywhere.</P>
<P>Restart <B>mythbackend</B> since it only reads this setting when it starts up.</P>
<P>On the faster machine:</P>
<P>Start the backend setup program.  Advance through the pages until you get to

ON for this machine.</P>
<P>Run <B>mythjobqueue</B>.  <B>mythjobqueue</B> will examine the JobQueue
and run any jobs it finds.  <B>mythjobqueue</B> should be left running so
that it will pick up any new commercial flagging jobs that are added to the

be flagged until you run manually run <B>mythjobqueue</B>.</P>

</H2>

<P>LVM greatly increases the flexibility you have in managing your storage
than traditional physical partitions. This section will provide some brief
notes on how to use LVM to create storage space for your video files and how
to add additional disk space in the future. There's lots more that can be
done with LVM, so check the LVM HOWTO 
<A HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/</A> document for details.</P>
<P>If you don't understand how to partition a drive, or how to change the
partition type you should stop and look at documentation on how to perform
these steps.</P>
<P>
<FIGURE>
<EPS FILE="stop.eps">
<IMG SRC="stop.png">
<CAPTION><B>BIG FAT WARNING</B>:  Using an incorrect parameter can make your files
inaccessible, prevent your computer from booting, etc.  Be careful!</CAPTION>
</FIGURE>
</P>
<P>Make sure your kernel configuration includes LVM support or that it's
available as a module. Today, most vendors include this by default. You'll
also want to ensure that you have a copy of the LVM utilities; check your
distribution, or get the latest versions from 
<A HREF="http://www.sistina.com/products_lvm.htm">http://www.sistina.com/products_lvm.htm</A> and build them manually.</P>
<P>Check that the <B>vgscan</B> program is being run at some point during
your boot sequence - most distributions do this by default. Look for a
message during boot up that looks like this: <CODE>vgscan -- reading all
physical volumes (this may take a while...)</CODE> If you don't see any
messages during boot, you may need to install a LVM init script or confirm
that you have all of the LVM packages installed from your distribution.</P>
<P>LVM uses a few concepts you should be familiar with before starting.
<UL>
<LI>PV (Physical Volume).  The actual partition on the hard drive.</LI>
<LI>VG (Volume Group).  The aggregation of all the PVs make a VG.</LI>
<LI>LV (Logical Volume).  Subdivision of the pool of space available in
the VG into individual chunks, like /usr, /var/video, etc.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The following example assumes that you want to create a LVM partition from a
chunk of space in /dev/hda5, using a reiserfs filesystem and mounted on
/var/video. You later decide to extend this filesystem by adding a new disk:
/dev/hdb.</P>
<P>You need to create at least one LVM partition for a physical volume. Use
<B>fdisk</B> or your favorite partition editor to set the type to LVM
(0x8e). If you're using an entire disk, create one big partition rather than
using the device itself. e.g. use /dev/hdb1 not /dev/hdb.  </P>
<P>In the following example, you have a 15GB disk.  The first 6GB are set as
your boot partition.  <CODE>/dev/hda2</CODE> was added as an extended partition,
and within that partition you created the <CODE>/dev/hda5</CODE> linux (ext2)
partition.</P>

<H2><A NAME="advancedpartitionformatting"></A> <A NAME="ss23.3">23.3</A> <A HREF="#toc23.3">Advanced Partition Formatting </A>
</H2>

<P>The partitions that your distribution sets up for you may not be
optimized for large files. Using LVM in conjunction with the following
techniques can be quite useful.</P>
<P>Unlike a typical filesystem, a MythTV video partition is usually a very
large filesystem filled with a fairly small number of large files.
Filesystem I/O is usually not an issue, even in multi-tuner and/or
multi-frontend setups.</P>
<P>There is however, one aspect of filesystem performance that can have a
bearing on the performance of MythTV.  In Linux, deleting a file will
utilize I/O bandwidth until the deletion has been completed.  If deleting
the file takes long enough, the video capture buffer may overrun, thereby
resulting in dropped frames.  Some filesystems are faster at deleting files
than others and, for multi-gigabyte MythTV video files, these differences
can be significant.</P>
<P>Fortunately, there are published tests (
<A HREF="http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html">http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html</A>) that provide
insight into filesystem performance under conditions relevant to MythTV
usage.  In addition, some limited testing (archived at 
<A HREF="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/users/52672">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/users/52672</A>)
with very large files (10 gigabytes) was reported in the MythTV Users
mailing list.</P>

<H3>Ext2</H3>

<P>Ext2 was the defacto standard Linux filesystem for many years.  It is
stable, provides good I/O performance and can quickly delete large files. 
The primary disadvantage of Ext2 is that it is not a journaling filesystem,
so a file system consistency check (fsck, which is normally only performed
after a system crash) can take many hours on a filesystem the size of a
typical MythTV partition.</P>

<H3>Ext3</H3>

<P>Ext3 is Ext2 with a journal, so your biggest gain is that in case of a
crash and reboot you won't have to wait very long for your partition to be
remounted.</P>
<P>There are options available when formatting an Ext3 partition, as in:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# mkfs.ext3 -T largefile4 /dev/hdb1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This example assumes that <CODE>/dev/hdb1</CODE> has already been created using
<B>fdisk</B>. If you're using LVM, <CODE>/dev/hdb1</CODE> may be something like
<CODE>/dev/VGforMyth/video</CODE>.</P>
<P>The "-T largefile4" option creates one inode per 4 megabytes, which can
provide a few percent more storage space.  However, tests indicate that
using the "-T largefile4" option can drastically increase the amount of time
required to delete a large file and thus it should only be used with encoder
settings that produce small video files (YMMV).</P>
<P>You can check on your filesystem using the <B>dumpe2fs</B> program. See
the man page for details.</P>
<H3>ReiserFS</H3>

<P>The Reiser filesystem is another journaling filesystem commonly
distributed with Linux.  It is known to be an extremely efficient filesystem
and it especially excels at managing partitions containing a large number of
small files.  However, tests indicate it is not the fastest at deleting very
large files.  For that reason, it may not be the best choice when using
encoder bitrates that produce very large files.</P>

<H3>JFS</H3>

<P>JFS (Journaling File System) is a journaling filesystem originally
developed by IBM for AIX which was later released as open source.  While not
as common as Ext3 or ReiserFS, it is distributed with RedHat 9 (RH9) and
Fedora Core 1 (RHFC1) and Mandrake as well as other distros.  According to
tests, JFS is the file deletion speed king, deleting virtually any file in
under one second, even files as large as 10 gigabytes.</P>

<H3>XFS</H3>

<P>XFS is a journaling file system originally developed by SGI for Irix, and
later released as open source.  While not a part of the default RedHat Linux
9 or Fedora Core installation (although it is a part of Mandrake and Fedora
Core 2), it can be easily installed via ATrpms.  XFS provides deletion
speeds for large files only slightly slower than JFS.  According to the test
results shown at (
<A HREF="http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html">http://aurora.zemris.fer.hr/filesystems/big.html</A>), XFS provide
higher I/O rates than JFS, albeit at a higher CPU loading.  This may cause
issues if you do not have the spare CPU capacity to handle XFS, potentially
leading to dropped frames.</P>
