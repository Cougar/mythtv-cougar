1.0 About
=========

	MythLCD is a little toy application that demonstrates how to use an
lcddevice which is an object available in libmyth.


2.0 Installation
================

	First place to start is with a working copy of the LCDproc package,
which you can find at or around:

		http://www.lcdproc.org	

	There are links from that URL to sites where you can order LCD
hardware that works with LCDproc. Note that even if you don't have hardware,
you can easily build a curses version of LCDproc that will let you
use/debug/play with mythLCD code.

	Once LCDproc is up and running, go into the mythlcd subdirectory and
type make. You may want to remove -DLCD_DEVICE_DEBUG from the CXXFLAGS line
in the Makefile, as it generates a lot of output. Note that the Makefile is
hand assembled and has nothing to do with higher level MythTV Makefiles.
This will (hopefully) change soon.
	
	IMPORTANT: a standard ./configure, make, make install at the MC/
level does not currently declare -DLCD_DEVICE in the compile and linking
lines for libmyth. To actually use mythlcd and/or the lcddevice object in
libmyth, you need to go into the libmyth subdirectory, do a Make clean, hand
edit the Makefile to add -DLCD_DEVICE to the CXXFLAGS definition, and then
make again. Then come back to MC/programs/mythlcd and do a make. You may
also need to fiddle with your LD_LIBRARY_PATH if libmyth is only built and
not installed anywhere. This will (hopefully) change soon.


3.0 FAQs
========

	First release, so no questions (and nothing frequent).


4.0 Plans/TODO
=============	
	
	Debug code and extend features
	Make the Myth programs actually use the object
