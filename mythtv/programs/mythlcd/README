1.0 About
=========

	MythLCD is essentially a single C++ object which can act as an
LCDproc client for MythTV applications. That means that data from a running
MythTV thread (channel information, music data, etc.) can be displayed on an
LCD screen on your MythTV box (or, since LCDproc is client/server based,
just about anywhere else instead).

	Note that at this very early stage, MythLCD is not actually
integrated into ANY of the MythTV/mythMusic/etc. code. It comes in
a standalone directory, with a little toy application (called mythlcd) that
just shows off how it could work. See TODO for when this might change.


2.0 Installation
================

	First place to start is with a working copy of the LCDproc package,
which you can find at or around:

		http://www.lcdproc.org	

	There are links from that URL to sites where you can order LCD
hardware that works with LCDproc. Note that even if you don't have hardware,
you can easily build a curses version of LCDproc that will let you
use/debug/play with mythLCD code.

	Once LCDproc is up and running, go into the mythlcd subdirectory and
type make. You may want to remove -DLCD_DEVICE_DEBUG from the CXXFLAGS line
in the Makefile, as it generates a lot of output. Note that the Makefile is
hand assembled and has nothing to do with higher level MythTV Makefiles.
This will change as the code is integrated into the rest of MythTV (see
TODO).


3.0 FAQs
========

	First release, so no questions (and nothing frequent).


4.0 Plans/TODO
