UPGRADING FROM PREVIEW RELEASE 1
--------------------------------
You need to add the record.sql script to the database, so, mysql < record.sql
This is not needed on a new install.

UPGRADING FROM PREVIEW RELEASE 2
--------------------------------
Follow the above instructions to add record.sql.  Do the same thing for
conflict.sql.  Again, not needed for a new install.

UPGRADING FROM PREVIEW RELEASE 3
--------------------------------
Do the same thing for conflictupdate.sql.  Not needed for a new install.
The channel icons were moved from /usr/local/share/mythtv/ to ~/.mythtv/channels
They'll be updated the next time you run the filldata script.  You can remove
all the .jpg and .gif files from the /usr/local/share/mythtv/ directory, if
you want.
