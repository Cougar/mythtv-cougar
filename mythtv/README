                              Mythical Convergence
			       Preview Release 1


There'll be more information here later, but for now:

BUILD/CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

There's basically two ways to configure this so far, with the program guide,
and without it.  If you want the program guide to work and have program 
information show up on channel changes, you just need to have a few more
pieces of external software installed.

One of these days I'll convert things over to use a real configure script, 
but I haven't bothered yet.

Basic 'live-tv' functionality
-----------------------------

All you really need, software wise, is:

   libmysqlclient - The MySQL client library.  It's not _really_ needed for the
                    basic functionality, but I haven't gotten around to making
                    it compile-time optional yet.  Get it from your distro,
                    or compile it yourself http://www.mysql.com

   libttf - Freetype v1.  Can't use v2, sorry.  This is used for the on-screen
            display.  Get it from your distro, or from http://freetype.sf.net

   libmp3lame - The shared library for the LAME mp3 encoder.  Again, not 
                _really_ needed, it just saves 500 or so MB per hour of 
                recording.  You'll probably have to compile this one yourself,
                get it from http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3/

You also need v4l setup and working properly.  If xawtv works, this should, too.

Hardware wise, you need a computer.  Really.  Helps to have a fast one, too.
You also need a video card with working Xv support (to scale and convert 
colorspaces), and a TV tuner card.

And that's all.  To compile the tv app, just cd into the 'tv' subdirectory.
Type 'make'.  If you get any link errors like 'Undefined reference to <blah>',
you're most likely missing one of the dependencies mentioned above.

There is no 'make install' yet.

IMPORTANT: You _must_ edit the settings.txt file in the tv before running the
           application.  

Specifically, you need to at least change the 'BufferName' preference to 
something that can exist on your machine.  Look through the rest of the file 
and change whatever else you want.  If you change the Width/Height settings 
and you don't get any video, then the resolution you selected wasn't liked by 
the v4l subsystem.

And that's it for the basic setup.  Run the 'mythtv' bin from the compile 
directory.  Use the arrow keys to change channels up and down, type in channel 
numbers to directly skip channels, use the 'p' key to pause/unpause, and the 
right/left arrow keys to ff/rew.  Escape quits. These keybindings aren't 
configurable yet.

Extended Functionality (Program Information and Guide)
------------------------------------------------------

To get program infomation showing up, you need the following additional bits:

   MySQL - You need this setup and working.  A recent version, I think, would
           be best.  I don't know, though, I'm utterly new to it.  Get it from
           your distro, or from http://www.mysql.com

   QT - You need at least QT 3.0.  Again, the best way to get this is from your
        distro.  Need the threadsafe version, and the mysql bindings for.
        http://www.trolltech.com

   XMLTV - You need at least version 0.5.  This will do the work of actually
           grabbing the program information.  Get it from:
           http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~epa98/work/apps/xmltv/
           Installing this was rather a pain for me on Debian, but I don't have
           any directions to do so.

   Perl - everyone should have this already, but hey, it's a requirement.

Ok.  Once you have all these additional dependencies installed, you need to 
configure XMLTV.  Just run 'tv_grab_na --configure'  and answer the questions.
I haven't used the other tv listing grabbers included in XMLTV, so if you're 
outside of the US or Canada, you're going to have to figure stuff out on your
own.  You'll probably also have to edit the 'grabdata' script to change the
hardcoded reference to tv_grab_na.  Patches welcome to fix that.

Anyway.  The next thing to do is set up the mysql database that the program data
will be stored in.  Change to the 'programdb' subdir of this distribution.
You need to run the mc.sql script.  So, something like mysql < mc.sql
might work.  I dunno.  It worked for me with the default mysql installation on
debian, might not work elsewhere.  Better instructions welcome.

Once the database is setup, run the filldata script also in the same directory.
This'll take awhile, as it's populating the database with the next week's worth
of program information.

The 'filldata' script should be run every day, around 10 pm or so.  If you want
updated program info, that is.  You don't have to run it at all, but then, 
what's the point of doing all this?  Probably should be crontab'd, but I'm not
certain if all the paths in the scripts are good for that yet.

Next, time to build the program guide binary.  Go to the 'epg' subdirectory
of the main distribution.  Type 'make'.  If you've got qt3 installed properly,
everything should compile all nicely.  Don't 'make install'. 

You now can run the 'epg' binary, and it should be populated with program info.
Use the arrow keys to move around in the grid.  'M' and 'Enter' quit.  So does
'C', but it's 'quit without selecting the channel'.

Anyway.  Now that you have the 'epg' binary built, and the program database
configured, go back and run the 'mythtv' binary  (from the tv subdir) again.
When you change channels, it should show the proper information on the OSD.
Hitting 'M' should pop up the program guide.  Exiting the program guide with
'Enter' or 'M' will change to the channel it currently was on, exiting with
'C' will just exit without changing the channel.

Feel free to send patches to ijr@po.cwru.edu
