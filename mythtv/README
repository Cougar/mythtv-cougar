                                   MythTV
			         Release 0.6


There'll be more information here later, but for now:

BUILD/CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

This is what you need, software wise, to have installed:

   libttf - Freetype 2 is now required (it used to only be able to use 
            freetype 1).  I _think_ any release will work, but I'm using 2.1.2.
            This is used for the on-screen display.  Get it from your distro, 
            or from http://freetype.sf.net

   libmp3lame - The shared library for the LAME mp3 encoder.  This might become
                optional in the future, or I may switch to vorbis if they speed
                optimize things a little more.  Compressing the audio's not
                _really_ necessary, it just saves 500 or so MB per hour of 
                recording.  You'll probably have to compile this one yourself,
                so get it from http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3/

   QT - You need at least QT 3.0.  Again, the best way to get this is from your
        distro.  You need it compiled threadsafe version, and the mysql bindings
        as well.  I'm using version 3.0.5.  http://www.trolltech.com

   MySQL - You need this setup and working.  A recent version, I think, would
           be best.  I don't know, though, I'm utterly new to it.  Get it from
           your distro, or from http://www.mysql.com

   XMLTV - You need at least version 0.5.  This will do the work of actually
           grabbing the program information.  Get it from:
           http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/
           Installing this was rather a pain for me on Debian, but I don't have
           any directions to do so.

You also need v4l setup and working properly.  If xawtv works, this should, too.

Hardware wise, you need a computer.  Really.  Helps to have a fast one, too.
You also need a video card with working Xv support (to scale and convert 
colorspaces), and a TV tuner card.

Ok.  Once you've got all the prerequisites installed, on to compiling.
First of all, do a quick './configure' to configure libavcodec.  Then just type
'make'.

Compiling note:  If you get an error on building this, that says something
                 about 'mkspecs', then you don't have the QTDIR environment
                 variable set.  On debian, this should be set to /usr/share/qt.
                 I hear on mandrake, it's /usr/lib/qt3.  You'll need to figure
                 out what it should be on your system, set the variable,
                 and attempt to compile again.

If you get any errors about missing references, etc, you most likely don't have
one of the required pieces of software installed.

Follow this by a 'make install'.  It'll put 'mythtv', 'mythdialog', 'mythepg',
and 'mythfrontend' in your /usr/local/bin directory, and create 
/usr/local/share/mythtv for you.

IMPORTANT: You _must_ edit the settings.txt file in /usr/local/share/mythtv/
           before running the application.  

Specifically, you need to at least change the 'BufferName' and the 
'RecordFilePrefix' preferences to directories that exist on your machine.  
Look through the rest of the file and change whatever else you want.  If you 
change the Width/Height settings and you don't get any video, then the 
resolution you selected wasn't liked by the v4l subsystem.

The next thing to do is set up the mysql database that the program data
will be stored in.  Change to the 'database' subdir of this distribution.
You need to run the mc.sql script.  So, something like mysql < mc.sql
might work.  I dunno.  It worked for me with the default mysql installation on
debian, might not work elsewhere.  Better instructions welcome.

See the UPGRADING file for information on upgrading between releases.

If you're in the US/Canada, you can proceed with the next step.  Otherwise, you
need to edit /usr/local/share/mythtv/settings.txt and edit the very first
setting -- XMLTVGrab.  Change this to the appropriate xmltv grabber 
(tv_grab_uk in the UK, etc).

Next, you need to run the setup program that should be located in the setup/ 
subdir.  It will ask you some questions about your hardware, and then run 
xmltv's grabber to configure your channels.

Once you've run the setup program, just run 'mythfilldata' to download and
insert a week's worth of program data into the database.  'mythfilldata' should
be run once a day, if you want to keep your database current.  If you want
more control over what channels get inserted into the databaes, or need to setup
finetuning amounts for specific channels (like in xawtv), run 
'mythfilldatabase --manual' instead.

Once 'mythfilldata' has finished, try running the 'mythepg' binary.  It should 
be populated with program info.  Use the arrow keys to move around in the grid.
'M' and 'Enter' quit.  So does 'C', but it's 'quit without selecting the 
channel'. 

Anyway.  Now that you have the program database populated and configured, try
running the 'mythtv' binary.  Use the arrow keys to change channels up and 
down, type in channel numbers to directly skip channels, use the 'p' key to 
pause/unpause, and the right/left arrow keys to ff/rew.  Escape quits.  
'c' will change inputs on the TV tuner card.  These keybindings aren't 
configurable yet.

When you change channels, it should show the proper information on the OSD.  
Hitting 'M' should pop up the program guide.  Exiting the program guide with 
'Enter' or 'M' will change to the channel it currently was on, exiting with 
'Escape' will just exit without changing the channel.  Pressing 'I' will let 
you get more information about a program, and if you're running mythfrontend, 
will allow you to schedule recordings.

If you have two tuner cards setup properly, you can hit 'V' to turn on/off the
Picture-in-Picture support, 'B' to toggle the active window (for channel 
changes and the like), and 'N' to swap the two active channels.

Ok, so try running 'mythfrontend'.  You should see a nice graphical menu show 
up. This should be pretty simple to figure out.  mythfrontend is designed to 
be the main interface of the application.  It also provides all the support for
scheduled recordings, so keep in mind that it needs to be running for 
shows to get recorded.

In the 'configfiles' subdir there are some example lirc config files to get a
remote working with this stuff.  Just use irxevent and it should all work.

Whew.  If you thought this compile process sucked, I'll accept pretty much
any patch sent my way that improves it.

Time for some more configuration.  There are a couple .txt files in 
/usr/local/share/mythtv/.  The theme.txt will let you switch between themes
for the menus.  There's also settings for the size the GUI is displayed at. 
Change em if you want.  You can copy the various settings files to your 
~/.mythtv/ directory if you want.

The mysql.txt file located in there controls the database settings, mainly in 
case you want to run the mysql server on another machine.

If you want to check out the theme format, and perhaps make your own, just
look at the .xml files in the /usr/local/share/mythtv/themes/[themename]
subdirs.
