                                   MythTV
			         Release 0.7


BUILD/CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

This is what you need, software wise, to have installed:

   libttf - Freetype 2 is now required (it used to only be able to use 
            freetype 1).  I _think_ any release will work, but I'm using 2.1.2.
            This is used for the on-screen display.  Get it from your distro, 
            or from http://freetype.sf.net

   libmp3lame - The shared library for the LAME mp3 encoder.  This might become
                optional in the future, or I may switch to vorbis if they speed
                optimize things a little more.  Compressing the audio's not
                _really_ necessary, it just saves 500 or so MB per hour of 
                recording.  You'll probably have to compile this one yourself,
                so get it from http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3/

   QT - You need at least QT 3.0.  Again, the best way to get this is from your
        distro.  You need it compiled threadsafe version, and the mysql bindings
        as well.  I'm using version 3.0.5.  http://www.trolltech.com

   MySQL - You need this setup and working.  A recent version, I think, would
           be best.  I don't know, though, I'm utterly new to it.  Get it from
           your distro, or from http://www.mysql.com

   XMLTV - You need at least version 0.5.  This will do the work of actually
           grabbing the program information.  Get it from:
           http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/
           Installing this was rather a pain for me on Debian, but I don't have
           any directions to do so.

See the mythtv-HOWTO.html or mythtv-HOWTO.txt file in the docs/ subdirectory
for in-depth instructions on installing and compiling mythtv and the
pre-requisites.

Debian users:  mythtv has been packaged by Matthew Zimmerman.  The package
is available from http://dijkstra.csh.rit.edu:8088/~mdz/mythtv/

You also need v4l setup and working properly.  If xawtv works, this should, too.

Hardware wise, you need a computer.  Really.  Helps to have a fast one, too.
You also need a video card with working Xv support (to scale and convert 
colorspaces), and a TV tuner card.  If you're using ALSA for sound support 
(which _is_ the recommended thing to do), you should be using version 0.9, not
0.5.

IMPORTANT: You _must_ edit the settings.txt file in /usr/local/share/mythtv/
           before running the application.  

If you change the Width/Height settings and you don't get any video, then
the resolution you selected wasn't liked by the v4l subsystem.

See the UPGRADING file for information on upgrading between releases.

Now would be a good time to look over 'keys.txt' for a list of all the 
keybindings.

Change em if you want.  You can copy the various settings files to your 
~/.mythtv/ directory if you want.

The mysql.txt file located in there controls the database settings, mainly in 
case you want to run the mysql server on another machine.

If you want to check out the theme format, and perhaps make your own, just
look at the .xml files in the /usr/local/share/mythtv/themes/[themename]
subdirs.
