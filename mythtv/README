                                   MythTV
			        Release 0.12


BUILD/CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------

This is what you need, software wise, to have installed:

   libttf - Freetype 2 is now required (it used to only be able to use 
            freetype 1).  I _think_ any release will work, but I'm using 2.1.2.
            This is used for the on-screen display.  Get it from your distro, 
            or from http://freetype.sf.net

   libmp3lame - The shared library for the LAME mp3 encoder.  This might become
                optional in the future, or I may switch to vorbis if they speed
                optimize things a little more.  Compressing the audio's not
                _really_ necessary, it just saves 500 or so MB per hour of 
                recording.  You'll probably have to compile this one yourself,
                so get it from http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3/

   QT - Version 3.1 or greater is strongly recommended.  MythTV will probably
        compile with version 3.0, but there are known to be bugs in that version        which can crash MythTV.  Again, the best way to get this is from your
        distro.  You need it compiled threadsafe version, and the mysql
        bindings as well.  I'm using version 3.1.1.  http://www.trolltech.com

   MySQL - You need this setup and working.  A recent version, I think, would
           be best.  I don't know, though, I'm utterly new to it.  Get it from
           your distro, or from http://www.mysql.com

   XMLTV - You need at the latest version (0.5.17 at the time of this writing).
           This will do the work of actually grabbing the program information.
           Get it from: http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/
          
See the mythtv-HOWTO.html or mythtv-HOWTO.txt file in the docs/ subdirectory
or on http://www.mythtv.org/docs/ for in-depth instructions on installing and 
compiling mythtv and all of the pre-requisites.  It has instructions for various
linux distributions.

You also need v4l setup and working properly.  If xawtv works (in grabdisplay
mode and with xv), this should, too.

Hardware wise, you need a computer.  Really.  Helps to have a fast one, too.
You also need a video card with working Xv support (to scale and convert 
colorspaces), and a TV tuner card.  If you're using ALSA for sound support 
(which _is_ the recommended thing to do), you should be using version 0.9, not
0.5.

See the UPGRADING file for information on upgrading between releases.

Compiling and setup instructions are all in the documentation in the docs/
subdir (or at http://www.mythtv.org/docs/ ) these days.  Read those carefully.

keys.txt has a listing of all the various key bindings.

If you want to check out the theme format, and perhaps make your own, just
look at the .xml files in the /usr/local/share/mythtv/themes/[themename]
subdirs.
