                              MythTV FAQ

) My mouse pointer disappears over the windows?
- This is desired behavior.  The interface is meant for use with a remote 
  control, or a keyboard.

) What's this 'strange error flushing buffer' mean?
- Nothing, really.  It's just lame (the mp3 encoder) complaining for some 
  obscure reason.

) The audio's _really_ out of sync, and it doesn't pause when I pause live TV?
- You need to mute the line-in, and set the mixer to record from the line in.
  The audio you're hearing is from the audio pass-through, enabled by the
  V4L driver, and not MythTV.

) I get an error when compiling about 'mkspecs'?
- You need to set QTDIR.  On Debian, it should be /usr/share/qt
  On Mandrake, it should be /usr/lib/qt3

) I can't change the channel when watching TV?
- Something's wrong with your program database.  Did filldata run with
  no major errors?

) I want to run the database on another machine?
- Ok, first, you'll need to edit the mc.sql script first to setup the proper 
  permissions for the machine that'll be running mythtv and connecting to the
  database.  Next, after you've followed all the directions and built all
  MythTV's programs, and after you've done a make install, but before you've 
  run filldata, you need to edit the /usr/local/share/mythtv/mysql.txt file
  to it points to the server you're running the mysql on.  If you want, you
  can copy that mysql.txt file to ~/.mythtv/.  If it's in ~/.mythtv/ then it
  won't get copied over by another, future, 'make install'.  Once that's all
  done, you should be all set, I think.

) Is it possible to have MythTV change the channel on my digital cable/satellite
  box, instead of my tuner card?
- Not quite yet.  See here:

  http://www.snowman.net/pipermail/mythtv-dev/2002-July/000020.html

  This feature is unfinished, and waiting for someone who wants it to finish it.

) Does the program guide only work in US?
- No, the program guide is built using xmltv 
  (http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~epa98/work/apps/xmltv/). 
  It current works in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, and Austria.

) Whenever I 'make install', it copies over my settings files?
- Simply copy the files you want to save to ~/.mythtv/ and they won't get
  overwritten anymore.  Changes to the settings files happen regularly, so you
  need to watch for these changes.
