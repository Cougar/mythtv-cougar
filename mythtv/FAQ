) My mouse pointer disappears over the windows?
- This is desired behavior.  The interface is meant for use with a remote 
  control, or a keyboard.

) What's this 'strange error flushing buffer' mean?
- Nothing, really.  It's just lame (the mp3 encoder) complaining for some 
  obscure reason.

) I get an error when compiling about 'mkspecs'?
- You need to set QTDIR.  On Debian, it should be /usr/share/qt
  On Mandrake, it should be /usr/lib/qt3

) I can't change the channel when watching TV?
- Something's wrong with your program database.  Did filldata run with
  no major errors?
