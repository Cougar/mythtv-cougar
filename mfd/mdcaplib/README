MDCAP is an acronym for "Myth Digital Content Access Protocol". It is (meant
to be) a mechanism for exchanging information about digital content. That
is, it allows a server process to explain to a client process what content
is available (including metadata about the content, and lists of content
items that could be accessed as a group). The client software can then ask
for (streaming) delivery of a given piece (or pieces) of content.

Within the context of MythTv/mfd, mdcap is the format in which HTTP-like
client server interactions between different processes on different systems
can "automagically" exchange audio/video/image/etc. content.
