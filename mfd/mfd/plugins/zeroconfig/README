    This is a plugin that supports zeroconfig service discovery (called
"Rendezvous" by Apple). That is, any mythbox running an mfd can
automagically discover any other mythboxes on the same LAN (anything before
a Router hop) that are also running an mfd (and all the services that mfd
offers). This is quite powerful.

    The plugin does two basic things (each in their own thread):

        1) Register *this* mfd's services on a multicast DNS port. That way,
           other mfd's (or any other software) can find those services.

        2) Listen for multicast DNS broadcasts from *other* mfd's, find
           those mfd's, and talk to them.

    This code is really an interface into mDNS code released by Apple. The
more or less unchanged Apple code is in ./apple/. Since what's in this
directory is clearly a derived work, it is covered by the Apple Public
License, which is available in ./apple/APPLE_LICENSE.
