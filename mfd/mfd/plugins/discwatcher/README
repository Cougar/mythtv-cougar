    The disc watcher just watches optical disc devices (CD drive, DVD drive)
to see if someone inserts something. If the disc is a CD or a DVD, it will
stick that new metadata into the metadata server (NB: only does audio at the
moment, so only CDs). If it's something else, it can (optionally) automount
the disc, look for relevant media (mp3's, images, etc.) and plunk that into
the metadata server.

    At some point it will have to understand recordable media and be able to
handle burning and/or report to something that does handle burning what the
state of the recordable media is.
