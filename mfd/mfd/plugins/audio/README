The mfd audio plugin decodes audio. Although it can probably be configured
to play audio directly, it's main use is to take that decoded audio and
stream it over RTSP. 

It has a very simple telnet interface that works like this:

telnet localhost 2343
play url file:///wherever/whatever/content.ogg
pause on
pause off
stop
seek foo    {where foo is a signed integer, seconds}
play item foo bar {where foo is container id, bar is an item id}
play playlist foo bar {where foo is container id, bar is an item id}

It also monitors the available services for maop (Myth Audio Output
Protocol) resources and can talk to them directly to turn audio output on
and off. So, from the same telnet port you can also do:

speakers list
speakers close foo
speakers open url foo
 

Where foo is the name of the speakers (one of the ones that came from
speakers list) and url is something of the form rtsp://hostname:port/
