    The daapclient plugin looks for daap services, ignores ones running on
the same host as this client, and keeps dynamically building a list of audio
metadata that is available on the local network.

    The point is that the metadata held by the mfd will always reflect all
audio content available anywhere on the network (whether from other mfd's,
or from anything else that happens to be serving it).

    If you want to connect to iTunes and play it's content, you'll need
libopendaap:

        http://crazney.net/programs/itunes/libopendaap.html

    There is a little problem with function names in version 0.1.1, so
you'll need to apply the patch provided in this directory. If you cd to the
libopendaap root directory, the patch should apply cleanly with:

        patch -p1 < libopendaap_md5_name_patch.diff

    Then build and install libopendaap. This will be fixed in a future
release of libopendaap.
