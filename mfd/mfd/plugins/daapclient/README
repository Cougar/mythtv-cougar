    The daapclient plugin looks for daap services, ignores ones running on
the same host as this client, and keeps dynamically building a list of audio
metadata that is available on the local network.

    The point is that the metadata held by the mfd will always reflect all
audio content available anywhere on the network (whether from other mfd's,
or from anything else that happens to be serving it).
