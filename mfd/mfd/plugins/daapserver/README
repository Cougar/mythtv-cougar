The mfd daap server plugin serves audio files via the daap protocol.

The code here is very closely based on the daapd project:

        (c) deleet 2003, Alexander Oberdoerster
        http://www.deleet.de/projekte/daap/daapd/

It also uses a bunch of routines from libhttpd, a small library for http
connections (which is how DAAP works). This library is originally Copyright
(c) 2002 Hughes Technologies Pty Ltd. It was modified by Alexander
Oberdoerster (for persistence).

    Note that this plugin does not build the stuff in httpd_persistent as a
library. It uses the code directly in the plugin.
