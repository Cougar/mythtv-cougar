    The mfd daap server plugin serves audio files via the daa protocol.

    The code here is very closely based on the daapd project:

    It includes the daaplib library (note, not the same as libdaap) in
./daaplib/. This library is largely unmodified, other than adding a qmake
pro file so that it will build with the rest of the mfd installation. The
library is built and linked staticly. Credits for daaplib are:

It also uses a bunch of routines from libhttpd, a small library for http
connections (which is how DAAP works). This library is originally Copyright
(c) 2002 Hughes Technologies Pty Ltd. It was modified by Alexander
Oberdoerster (for persistence). The httpd library is built and linked staticly.
