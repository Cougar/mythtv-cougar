    The mfd daap server plugin serves audio files via the daa protocol.

    The code here is very closely based on the daapd project:

    It includes the daaplib library (note, not the same as libdaap) in
./daaplib/. This library is largely unmodified, other than adding a qmake
pro file so that it will build with the rest of the mfd installation. The
library is built and linked staticly. Credits for daaplib are:
