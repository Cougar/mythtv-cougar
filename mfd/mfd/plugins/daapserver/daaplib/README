PURPOSE

daaplib is a very tiny and portable C++ library which helps to read and
write low-level DAAP streams in memory. the code is fairly straightforward
and can mirror the structure of the data fairly well.


ABOUT DAAP

DAAP is an http-based protocol for serving music content (and probably other
media, too) over TCP/IP networks. DAAP was established by Apple iTunes 4.0
in April 2003. Official documentation is not available to date.

INSTALLATION

run 'make' followed by 'make install' in the distribution src directory.

DAAP-lib has been tested on the following systems:

Windows 2000 (VC6, Intel C Compiler 4)
MacOS X 10.2.5 (gcc 3.1, gcc 3.3)
Linux (gcc 2.95)
IRIX 6.2 (gcc 2.95)

but it should compile and run on most POSIX systems with minimal changes. Please contact the authors if you manage to run DAAP-lib on systems not listed here. 


KNOWN ISSUES

the name can easily be confused with libdaap.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The authors wish to thank Todd Larason for help with deciphering the DAA protocol. Thanks to Julian Gough, who pointed out how to *really* install daaplib.
