The mfd speakers plugin is a bit of code that can be asked to listen to an
RTSP stream and output the audio (audio only) via hardware (ie. a
soundcard). It has a simple telnet protocol that understands how to:

open rtsp://somehost:aport/
close

The mfd audio plugin listens for service announcements from speaker plugins
on the local LAN (service type maop - Myth Audio Output Porotocl) and knows
how to make them listen in when something is playing and close themselves
off when there's nothing to listen to.
