    The mfd mythmusic plugin monitors audio files that are "owned" by the
myth music tables and keeps building an in memory metadata collection of
them.

    This plugin does _not_ play audio files (see the audio plugin). It does
not, in and of itself, serve out any content. It just scans the directory
that mythmusic owns and keeps the database in sync, staying on top of file
additions or deletions.
