libmfdclient - README
---------------------

    This is a library intended to simplify building client applications that
can talk to a running mfd (or a whole bunch of 'em).

    It uses zeroconfig to find the mfd's. Please note, the code included in
./mdnsd/ is originally licensed as GPL and/or BSD and/or other by the
original author and copyright holder. The copy included here is licensed
under the GPL version 2 only. 

    Upon initialization, the client library exposes an interface object
called an MfdInterface. This MfdInterface can then be queried to get
information about MfdInstance objects. These instances of available mfd's on
the network can further be queried to get metadata, ask for audio to be
played, etc. Note that an mfd, and therefore an MfdInstace object can
dissappear at any time. That's why the interface does not provide direct
access to the MfdInstance objects themselves.

    The MfdInterface present a regular Qt object to the client programmer.
Although threads are used internally to talk to various mfd plugins, the
interface to the client developer is a single threaded application that runs
in the Qt event loop. This (is intended to?) greatly simplify writing client
GUI stuff.
