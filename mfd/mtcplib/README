MTCP is an acronym for "Myth TransCoding Protocol". It is (meant to be) a
mechanism for exchanging information about transcoding jobs. That is, it
allows a server process to explain to a client process what content is being
transcoded. The client software can also ask for transcoding jobs to be
started and stopped.
